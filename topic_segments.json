SPEAKER_01: I'll go back to Sydney for the week. SPEAKER_01: And I'll come out to like the Gold Coast, SPEAKER_01: see you there. SPEAKER_01: And then it's just, SPEAKER_01: It sounds fun. SPEAKER_01: It was very fun. SPEAKER_01: It was big chilling. SPEAKER_00: How is it hanging out with like, SPEAKER_00: you see, obviously you see Rob quite often SPEAKER_00: and talk to him. SPEAKER_00: He's local and same. SPEAKER_00: But everyone else like, SPEAKER_00: you don't see Preston that much, for example. SPEAKER_01: No, I haven't seen him in years and years. SPEAKER_01: But SPEAKER_00: back in the day, SPEAKER_00: it was, you had like your group. SPEAKER_00: Yes. SPEAKER_00: You had the pack and that you talked every day. SPEAKER_00: And obviously with the Sidemen growing up, SPEAKER_00: I'm like, now you don't see them. SPEAKER_00: Do you find it different hanging out with them all now? SPEAKER_01: No, we're still boys. SPEAKER_01: We're boys from back in the day. SPEAKER_00: Is it like exactly how it was kind of thing? SPEAKER_00: Back in SPEAKER_01: the day. SPEAKER_01: Genuinely, yeah. SPEAKER_01: And I feel like both groups came together SPEAKER_01: in the same way. SPEAKER_01: Like we all had a hundred YouTubers SPEAKER_01: we'd record with SPEAKER_01: and we were like, SPEAKER_01: these groups of guys, they're the boys. SPEAKER_01: We want to make videos with them. SPEAKER_01: Let's make a group together SPEAKER_01: because we enjoy making videos so much. SPEAKER_01: So I feel like even like in 10 years time, SPEAKER_01: like if we weren't making Sidemen videos together, SPEAKER_01: like we'd still be like, this is the boys. SPEAKER_01: So no, it was good fun. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, hanging with everyone, SPEAKER_02: it was good. Unknown: Well SPEAKER_00: yeah, we were talking, SPEAKER_00: me, JJ and Toby were talking about like, SPEAKER_00: will the Sidemen see each other out of YouTube time? SPEAKER_00: If you know what I mean? SPEAKER_00: Like for example, no one's gone and seen Ethan's baby yet. SPEAKER_00: And admittedly, it's a month old. SPEAKER_00: It's not really a thing. SPEAKER_00: She, she is a month old. SPEAKER_02: I don't always say it and gets hold the fuck off. SPEAKER_00: She is a month old SPEAKER_00: and until they're like a year and a half or whatever, SPEAKER_00: they're just kind of like a blob. SPEAKER_00: True, true, true, true, true. SPEAKER_00: But no one's seen her yet. SPEAKER_00: Yes. SPEAKER_00: Will, is it because of the amount of recording we do SPEAKER_00: that no one does? SPEAKER_00: Or is it kind of like, SPEAKER_00: no one will until. SPEAKER_00: Are we bad people? SPEAKER_00: Or are we bad people? SPEAKER_00: I SPEAKER_02: think that one is true. SPEAKER_02: No, no, I think it's both, right? SPEAKER_02: Like the schedule is mad. SPEAKER_02: Cause also like, also like, SPEAKER_02: I think it's also weird to invite yourself around SPEAKER_02: to like a baby house, right? SPEAKER_02: You can't. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, you gotta wait for the right time. SPEAKER_02: But also like, yeah, if you've got a shoot on Tuesday, SPEAKER_02: you know, Ethan's gonna be there. SPEAKER_02: You're not really gonna go like, oh, hey, let's go. SPEAKER_02: You know, but we still try and do the troops meals SPEAKER_02: now and then. SPEAKER_02: We need to link up for it. SPEAKER_01: But I genuinely like, yeah, everyone's so busy. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's like, it's SPEAKER_00: crazy, crazy, crazy. SPEAKER_00: I SPEAKER_02: think when we all like, well, SPEAKER_02: when everyone slows down, SPEAKER_02: there'll be more trips that we do. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's the thing. SPEAKER_01: Cause yeah, like a lot of the guys, SPEAKER_01: like Lannan, Locky, Rob, SPEAKER_01: like they're not doing loads and loads of content. SPEAKER_01: But it's, we still, SPEAKER_01: and we don't make any content together, SPEAKER_01: but we still just hang out. SPEAKER_00: Were you, you've slowed down with content. SPEAKER_00: Yes. SPEAKER_00: In terms of personal stuff. SPEAKER_00: Yes. SPEAKER_00: How, SPEAKER_01: like, how, Unknown: how SPEAKER_00: is it? SPEAKER_00: I don't want to ask you such a, SPEAKER_00: I don't want to ask you such a basic question, SPEAKER_00: but obviously like you were doing four videos a day. SPEAKER_01: Right, four, five, six. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: It's hard to do, but I enjoy it. SPEAKER_01: No, it's, it's nice to, yeah. SPEAKER_01: Chill, yeah. SPEAKER_01: And just not, it's like, I always used to like, SPEAKER_01: say it was like, you started a stopwatch. SPEAKER_01: When you're doing daily uploads, SPEAKER_01: you upload a video, you work, SPEAKER_01: you upload a video, when you've done that, SPEAKER_01: you're like, let's say a clock going for the next year. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, it's true, man. SPEAKER_01: You get caught in that cycle, SPEAKER_01: and I think it's a good cycle to have, SPEAKER_01: but I just got to a point where I was just like, SPEAKER_01: okay, I want to step, step away from this, SPEAKER_01: just because I wasn't enjoying it much. SPEAKER_01: After like, among us on Warzone, SPEAKER_01: there weren't any games that I enjoyed. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, yeah. SPEAKER_01: So I was like, I'm not going to either pretend SPEAKER_01: to enjoy a game or sit and make content on a game SPEAKER_01: I don't enjoy, because then it's, SPEAKER_01: no, why would anyone watch that? SPEAKER_01: It doesn't make any sense. SPEAKER_01: So it just, yeah, didn't, didn't make sense. SPEAKER_01: And then like, with the cyber and stuff, SPEAKER_01: we're doing a lot more nowadays. SPEAKER_01: And I really enjoy that. SPEAKER_01: And I kind of like being able to put more time SPEAKER_01: and effort into that. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, SPEAKER_02: yeah. SPEAKER_02: I know you should do a lot of meetings as well. SPEAKER_02: So it's not like you do just nothing, right? SPEAKER_02: You go travel, do like meetings and that. SPEAKER_01: Yes, yes, yes. SPEAKER_02: Yeah. SPEAKER_02: You did a stream recently though, SPEAKER_02: that like seems just bang, by the way, SPEAKER_02: like on TikTok. SPEAKER_02: Like you did a, you did a sponsor stream. SPEAKER_02: Oh SPEAKER_01: yeah, it was good of clips. SPEAKER_01: It was good of clips. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and then after a few weeks, SPEAKER_00: I was like, fucking hell, bro. SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I just did a little fortnight. SPEAKER_00: That's what you announced you were SPEAKER_02: getting, right? SPEAKER_02: And I was like, wow, this guy's farming. SPEAKER_02: He's taking all my topics from the pocket. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that was good though. SPEAKER_02: Or you asked a question, did I just button? SPEAKER_02: No. SPEAKER_02: Oh, okay. SPEAKER_02: Speaking of warzone, warzone two is around the corner. SPEAKER_01: Yes. SPEAKER_01: I will jump on. SPEAKER_01: I will see how it goes. SPEAKER_01: But from what I've seen, SPEAKER_01: it doesn't look different enough to warzone. SPEAKER_01: Like we need something fresh and new, SPEAKER_01: like the level that what, you know, SPEAKER_01: fortnight was to pubg, warzone was to fortnight, SPEAKER_01: that new wave. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we need that area, yeah. SPEAKER_02: But I SPEAKER_01: feel SPEAKER_02: like, like fortnight is still, SPEAKER_02: with the no build mode, SPEAKER_02: it's still like somewhat playable. SPEAKER_02: I feel like still people have gone a lot, SPEAKER_02: whereas I feel like fortnight has continued SPEAKER_02: its relevancy somewhat. SPEAKER_02: Whereas warzone just feels like it's empty now. SPEAKER_02: It's like a ghost town. SPEAKER_02: I know people stream every day, SPEAKER_02: but like, SPEAKER_02: 50,000 people used to grow it. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, like, now it's a ghost town. SPEAKER_02: Everyone's just waiting for warzone two. SPEAKER_02: We're also, I remember everyone's waiting SPEAKER_02: for Caldera, the new map, SPEAKER_02: and then a week later, SPEAKER_02: everyone's pretending they liked it. SPEAKER_02: I was like, bro, this is really fun. SPEAKER_02: And then like, I just stopped playing. Unknown: I'm SPEAKER_00: like, bro, bring them back. SPEAKER_00: I think warzone two is gonna be the same. SPEAKER_00: Everyone's gonna be like, SPEAKER_00: say, new warzone. SPEAKER_00: Yeah, two weeks. SPEAKER_01: Do you know, I think the biggest issue SPEAKER_01: is that it won't reestablish your skill gap. SPEAKER_01: What makes a game hype, exciting, and big SPEAKER_01: is a skill gap. SPEAKER_01: The start of fortnight, SPEAKER_01: no one knew what they were doing. SPEAKER_01: You build your little two by two. SPEAKER_01: Someone works out how to do like a wall rap. SPEAKER_01: And it's like, oh, that's nuts. SPEAKER_01: It's like, I'm gonna learn to do that. SPEAKER_01: And then I'm gonna win the fights. SPEAKER_01: And it was like that. SPEAKER_01: And then with warzone, it was like, SPEAKER_01: oh, I'm gonna learn these guns are good. SPEAKER_01: Oh, if you slide cancel, you can get around faster. SPEAKER_01: If you lean on these walls, SPEAKER_01: you can do better if you do this kind of stuff. SPEAKER_01: If you spam UAVs, SPEAKER_01: you're gonna be able to get loads of kills. SPEAKER_01: But when everyone knows it, it's not fun. SPEAKER_01: And when everyone practices it, SPEAKER_01: everyone gets so good. SPEAKER_01: It's like, it's not as exciting. SPEAKER_01: So I feel like warzone two, SPEAKER_01: it's gonna be mechanically very similar. SPEAKER_02: Yeah. SPEAKER_02: And also for like warzone was like a town in a place. SPEAKER_02: Because of lockdown and COVID, SPEAKER_02: everyone was kind of like nonstop playing it. SPEAKER_02: So it's more like the moment in town that we all miss, SPEAKER_02: not necessarily the game. SPEAKER_02: If the game still existed now in Verdance, SPEAKER_02: I don't think it still would be what it was. SPEAKER_02: Same as Among Us. SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. SPEAKER_00: Like Among Us was the like, it was the lockdown game. SPEAKER_00: Everyone enjoyed it for a little bit now. SPEAKER_00: I mean, we could literally play it. SPEAKER_00: We still enjoy it for the more time. SPEAKER_00: I'm so glad SPEAKER_01: we're able to keep it alive SPEAKER_01: because it is such a content platform. SPEAKER_02: It's because the lobbies are so bad though. SPEAKER_02: Like our lobby is awful when we play. SPEAKER_02: That's why it's good. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the good lobbies were always boring. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, when people got good at the game, SPEAKER_02: it's got really boring. SPEAKER_02: I've just, I've checked you've done like upload SPEAKER_02: for like two points, three seconds instead of two. SPEAKER_02: Like bro. SPEAKER_02: But I used to be, SPEAKER_00: I just used to lie about that stuff. SPEAKER_00: I used to go like, are you in did that for a second? SPEAKER_00: But it actually takes like 1.5 seconds. SPEAKER_00: And they go, oh, you're a little nerd. SPEAKER_00: And I was like, I was lying. SPEAKER_01: Have you set up with enough SPEAKER_02: confidence? SPEAKER_02: I love you always get like, SPEAKER_02: if you're high level as well, you get fucked. SPEAKER_02: Well, because of the mod SPEAKER_00: ones we do now, SPEAKER_00: Ethan got modded to like level 65. SPEAKER_00: And I'm only level 18. Unknown: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: So now I can't be voted out just for level. SPEAKER_02: But I remember how long that last one was took to get going. SPEAKER_02: Oh no. SPEAKER_02: That's not the mod. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah. SPEAKER_02: Cause I was not in that episode, SPEAKER_02: but I was in two of the recordings SPEAKER_02: cause we never actually got SPEAKER_01: it Unknown: done. SPEAKER_01: I'll tell you what, SPEAKER_01: trying to install gaming mods with people SPEAKER_01: that don't know how to use computers. SPEAKER_01: People that don't know how to actually not, SPEAKER_01: I'm not going to, SPEAKER_01: I was about to say people who can't install windows. SPEAKER_01: JJ was actually, all right. SPEAKER_01: JJ was one of the better ones. SPEAKER_01: Oh no, no, no. SPEAKER_01: We'll call him out. SPEAKER_01: Theo Baker. SPEAKER_00: Theo Baker doesn't know how to use, SPEAKER_00: like he was like, okay, SPEAKER_00: so now do I need to turn my PC on? Unknown: And then he got hacked. SPEAKER_02: It's who started, he actually got physically hacked SPEAKER_02: and still beat me. SPEAKER_02: What the hell? SPEAKER_02: He still beat me even though he was getting hacked. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: There's a lot of fun stuff you can do in gaming SPEAKER_01: with modded stuff, SPEAKER_01: but just trying to set it up and make it work. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: That's the issue. SPEAKER_00: That's, as much as I enjoy how bad our lobby is, SPEAKER_00: it's almost getting to the point where it's too bad SPEAKER_00: that I said like, SPEAKER_00: can we introduce a sheriff role? SPEAKER_00: Where all it is is one person can try and kill the imposter SPEAKER_00: and if they get it wrong, they die instead. SPEAKER_02: That's it. SPEAKER_02: Try to explain. SPEAKER_02: Larry was SPEAKER_00: like, don't really understand it. SPEAKER_00: I don't want to play that. SPEAKER_00: It sounds too complicated. SPEAKER_00: And JJ went, yeah, no, I don't like that. SPEAKER_00: I don't understand it. SPEAKER_02: Also, our attention span, this is such an easy world. SPEAKER_02: When we go to the other map, SPEAKER_02: everyone's attention span just dies. SPEAKER_02: Like we played the regular map, was it Skrulls? SPEAKER_02: The Skrulls. SPEAKER_02: Skrulls. SPEAKER_02: And we go to the polis. SPEAKER_02: Yeah. SPEAKER_02: And everyone's like, no, I can't play this game anymore. SPEAKER_02: But SPEAKER_01: Skrulls SPEAKER_00: is so small. SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but SPEAKER_01: it's just classic man. SPEAKER_01: You ever take the walk to polis? SPEAKER_01: Oh my God. SPEAKER_01: I actually liked that a lot. SPEAKER_01: I actually really enjoyed that. SPEAKER_01: I know as soon SPEAKER_00: as we play polis again, I'm seeing that. SPEAKER_00: I want that. SPEAKER_00: I think SPEAKER_01: we should actually, SPEAKER_01: I saw a lot of comments saying SPEAKER_01: the new Sidemen house map is cool, SPEAKER_01: but it's too big. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we've done it. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we should just take the custom skins and go back. SPEAKER_01: Or we could even get, SPEAKER_01: we should actually, we should request a custom polis. SPEAKER_01: So it's a polis, but with a Sidemen theming like that. SPEAKER_01: That would be cool. SPEAKER_01: We should have that made just as- SPEAKER_01: We need to SPEAKER_00: do prox as well. SPEAKER_00: Everyone is screaming prox. SPEAKER_00: I'm traumatized SPEAKER_01: by proximity. SPEAKER_01: He used to crash my computer. SPEAKER_01: Oh, did it? SPEAKER_02: Okay. SPEAKER_02: He used to crash my computer. SPEAKER_02: Oh, it did? SPEAKER_02: I remember this shit all the time. SPEAKER_02: It did. SPEAKER_01: And I would keep rejoining the lobby SPEAKER_01: like every second game in a half. SPEAKER_01: And I'd be trying to stream SPEAKER_01: so my whole stream would end. SPEAKER_01: I remember this. SPEAKER_01: That was dramatic. SPEAKER_01: I come traumatized by that mod. SPEAKER_01: That SPEAKER_00: mod is so, it's so good though. SPEAKER_00: The moment where you find JJ. SPEAKER_00: JJ, yeah, yeah, yeah. SPEAKER_00: And JJ's like, like, like, oh shit. SPEAKER_00: Oh, shit. SPEAKER_00: That moment is goaded. SPEAKER_02: I feel like it's nice because like, SPEAKER_02: JJ really enjoys it as well. SPEAKER_02: You can tell when he's in it. SPEAKER_02: Yeah. SPEAKER_02: And that's always nice to see. SPEAKER_02: It's a good game, man. SPEAKER_02: It's a very good like concept, SPEAKER_02: but it's just, yeah, people took it too serious. SPEAKER_02: I remember when we used to play with Talia, SPEAKER_02: then it got to a point where she hated our lobby. SPEAKER_02: Oh yeah. SPEAKER_02: No, she won't SPEAKER_00: play with us. SPEAKER_00: She likes to play like, she's like, SPEAKER_00: why would you troll? SPEAKER_02: She's SPEAKER_00: like, why would you not want to try and win? SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: Something like that. SPEAKER_02: That's enough for me. SPEAKER_02: We just vote someone out. SPEAKER_02: Some people just talking it voted out. SPEAKER_02: No reason. SPEAKER_02: JJ says something. SPEAKER_02: Oh, man. SPEAKER_02: Why are you washed? SPEAKER_02: The most SPEAKER_00: recent video is actually, SPEAKER_00: oh, Vic talks a lot when he's in pasta. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: Vote him out and he's out. SPEAKER_00: Was it you as well? SPEAKER_00: No. SPEAKER_00: No, SPEAKER_01: that was SPEAKER_00: the SPEAKER_01: worst part. SPEAKER_01: I feel like I talk a lot all of the time. SPEAKER_00: Well, there was only three. SPEAKER_00: It was only like you and two people left. SPEAKER_00: It SPEAKER_01: was me, Toby, Viz and Jamie. SPEAKER_00: Four. SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so four and it was, I think it was Jamie. SPEAKER_00: And Toby SPEAKER_01: was like, Vic, what happened? SPEAKER_01: I explained exactly what happened. SPEAKER_01: You're talking a lot. SPEAKER_01: I voted out. SPEAKER_01: I was like, why? SPEAKER_02: Remember when Toby played me with a sympathy card once? SPEAKER_02: Oh, you always say it's me, man. SPEAKER_02: You always say it's me. SPEAKER_02: He did that recently. SPEAKER_02: He did that recently. SPEAKER_02: And it was him. SPEAKER_02: I SPEAKER_01: know, man. SPEAKER_02: And also Ethan, that's the memorable moment SPEAKER_02: where he's like, ha, Simon, I got you. SPEAKER_02: I got you. SPEAKER_02: Finally. SPEAKER_02: That was SPEAKER_01: incredible. SPEAKER_01: He was burning. SPEAKER_01: He was burning after SPEAKER_02: that one. SPEAKER_02: He was, he was. SPEAKER_02: But obviously Warzone had the, going back to Warzone now. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the Warzone Wednesdays, which was huge for you. SPEAKER_02: Yeah. SPEAKER_02: You still like the most like decorated SPEAKER_02: Warzone Wednesdays. SPEAKER_02: Oh, no, no, no.

SPEAKER_00: Minecraft Monday SPEAKER_01: was kind of SPEAKER_00: lit though. SPEAKER_00: Minecraft Monday was good. SPEAKER_00: Minecraft Monday was good. SPEAKER_01: Fortnite Fridays was sick. SPEAKER_01: And it's because I got bullied in Fortnite Fridays. SPEAKER_01: When Warzone Wednesday came up, SPEAKER_01: I was like, it's not a game. SPEAKER_01: It's not a game now. SPEAKER_01: I remember SPEAKER_02: when you played with like Wars or Jukeys, right? SPEAKER_02: You'd be like the brains of the general SPEAKER_02: and they just go and fucking like. SPEAKER_01: Squad capital. SPEAKER_01: Oh, the growl. SPEAKER_01: What a beautiful gun. SPEAKER_01: How's that go on? SPEAKER_01: This is such a sick time. SPEAKER_01: No, you know what?

SPEAKER_01: It's a whole new universe, SPEAKER_01: whole new set of skills, SPEAKER_01: whole new weapons, vehicles, everything. SPEAKER_01: That's what we need. SPEAKER_01: We need someone to do it. SPEAKER_00: Do you think the Sidemen should do a tournament ever SPEAKER_00: of like, we're not in it. SPEAKER_00: We're just like, SPEAKER_00: you can see how Warzone Wednesday was Keems, right? SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: Like that, but Sidemen won. SPEAKER_00: The next time a game pops off. SPEAKER_00: We should. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: Honestly, SPEAKER_01: we should. SPEAKER_01: Cause yeah, you get, SPEAKER_01: we can pump the viewership so much. SPEAKER_01: You get crazy sponsors. SPEAKER_01: It could be like a way bigger prize pool. Unknown: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: Well, there you go. SPEAKER_00: It's coming. SPEAKER_02: We just need a game. SPEAKER_02: What's going on? SPEAKER_02: Where are the games, man? SPEAKER_02: I SPEAKER_01: feel like it has to be a Battle Royale game. SPEAKER_01: It does. SPEAKER_01: Just like, like competitive Overwatch, SPEAKER_01: competitive Valorant. SPEAKER_01: Like I just don't care when they respawn. SPEAKER_01: It doesn't have the same build. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: Like H1Z1, like PUBG. SPEAKER_01: Like when you're watching that person, SPEAKER_01: who's been sweating for 20 minutes, SPEAKER_01: just trying to win every gunfight, every 50-50, SPEAKER_01: they've won like 12 of them in a row. SPEAKER_01: And it comes down to that. SPEAKER_01: It's that build is so entertaining. SPEAKER_01: We need it. SPEAKER_01: But it's crazy because it can be the same game. SPEAKER_01: Like it could be literally Caldera, SPEAKER_01: but people just don't care in the same way. SPEAKER_01: It's not as exciting. SPEAKER_00: Well, you were talking about like your PC breaking and stuff. SPEAKER_00: That was at your flat, right? SPEAKER_00: Yes. SPEAKER_00: Now you're in a house. SPEAKER_01: Same PC, I think. SPEAKER_01: It's the same one now? SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: Okay. Well, then prox might not happen. SPEAKER_00: Well, SPEAKER_02: that's just to be fair, SPEAKER_02: the mod has probably changed so much. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah. SPEAKER_02: I think it's really easy now. SPEAKER_02: We'll give it a run. SPEAKER_00: But you're living in a house. SPEAKER_00: I am. SPEAKER_00: How is it? SPEAKER_00: It's... SPEAKER_00: Because he's now living in a house. SPEAKER_00: It's nice. SPEAKER_00: Barely, though. SPEAKER_00: But he is off. SPEAKER_00: Oh, I thought SPEAKER_02: you were making a joke SPEAKER_02: of how small my house is. SPEAKER_02: No. Unknown: Like SPEAKER_02: barely. SPEAKER_02: Have SPEAKER_00: you caught a house or like you moved? Unknown: You SPEAKER_00: moved and you moved.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I've been traveling London. SPEAKER_02: I went away to America as well. SPEAKER_02: Are you overlapping SPEAKER_01: your flat and your house SPEAKER_01: or are you keeping both? SPEAKER_02: No, the flat's gone. SPEAKER_02: I don't know. SPEAKER_02: I was going to, but I got advised SPEAKER_02: by my accountants to not do that SPEAKER_02: because I do hotels instead SPEAKER_02: because of business costs. SPEAKER_02: Smart, write it off. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, yeah. SPEAKER_00: He literally moved and then like four days later SPEAKER_00: went away for a week, SPEAKER_00: came back for like five days, SPEAKER_00: went away for a week. SPEAKER_02: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: So. SPEAKER_02: And that's annoying because I've got like, SPEAKER_02: there's a desk over there SPEAKER_02: that I'm being set up. SPEAKER_02: This could be like a little... SPEAKER_02: Yeah. SPEAKER_02: So my plan was to have a studio here SPEAKER_02: for streaming and music. SPEAKER_02: So when I traveled here, SPEAKER_02: nothing changes. SPEAKER_02: So it's just the same. SPEAKER_02: But then like, SPEAKER_02: we moved the podcast studio as well. SPEAKER_02: The same time I moved house. SPEAKER_02: So it's just been really annoying SPEAKER_02: to get everything organized. SPEAKER_02: And even my house is now still full of boxes. SPEAKER_02: Like we've got one of the spare rooms. SPEAKER_02: It's probably, you can't even get into it. SPEAKER_02: I cleared SPEAKER_01: out a load of boxes today. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, yeah. SPEAKER_01: I'm still going through boxes. SPEAKER_01: It's just, it be that way. SPEAKER_02: How's it been living in the house? SPEAKER_01: No, it's nice. SPEAKER_01: I really enjoy it. SPEAKER_01: It's peaceful. SPEAKER_01: It's like, SPEAKER_01: actually one thing that I spent, SPEAKER_01: when I come into London now, SPEAKER_01: it's so busy. SPEAKER_01: I didn't realize how much of a blessing it was in lockdown. SPEAKER_01: Get across London, no traffic. SPEAKER_01: Walk through central London. SPEAKER_01: What do you SPEAKER_00: mean get across London? SPEAKER_00: Where were you going in lockdown? SPEAKER_01: So Sidemen's shoes. SPEAKER_01: We were allowed as well. SPEAKER_01: We didn't have any, SPEAKER_00: bro. SPEAKER_00: We're not in lockdown. SPEAKER_00: Not on one way. SPEAKER_00: You're not allowed to work. SPEAKER_00: The one way SPEAKER_01: we were allowed to work. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, yeah. SPEAKER_01: The rule of six. SPEAKER_01: Where we went and did a muck bang SPEAKER_01: and sat three meters away from each SPEAKER_02: other. SPEAKER_02: I'll admit, one day in lockdown one, SPEAKER_02: I did go to JJ's. SPEAKER_01: I'm telling the government. SPEAKER_01: He can. SPEAKER_01: He just did. SPEAKER_01: It was one of them SPEAKER_02: ones where like, SPEAKER_02: no one really got the rules. SPEAKER_02: Oh, I didn't believe it. SPEAKER_02: I'm like, sure you're not. SPEAKER_02: Like, sure you can still go out. SPEAKER_02: And then I went, I got a cab, right? SPEAKER_02: And there's no one in London at all. SPEAKER_02: I thought the only guy I was like, SPEAKER_02: shit, maybe I should have stayed at home. SPEAKER_02: Maybe I should have followed the rules now. SPEAKER_02: Fuck me. SPEAKER_02: It's fine. SPEAKER_02: You can leave that. SPEAKER_02: I don't care. SPEAKER_02: It SPEAKER_01: was a very dystopian time. SPEAKER_01: I remember I was sat in a park once SPEAKER_01: and someone came up and they're like, SPEAKER_01: are you doing your hour of exercise? SPEAKER_01: I'm just sat on my own in the park. SPEAKER_01: I guess I'll walk in a circle. SPEAKER_01: It's like, how crazy is that? SPEAKER_01: A police officer asked me, SPEAKER_01: why are we just sat by a tree outside? SPEAKER_01: You SPEAKER_02: should get one of those hand exercises. SPEAKER_02: Just sit there doing this. SPEAKER_02: Do you ever see SPEAKER_00: the one of like, SPEAKER_00: like 20 guys just on this street SPEAKER_00: and a policeman comes up and they just start like, Unknown: hi SPEAKER_01: nice everyone. SPEAKER_00: Hi nice. SPEAKER_00: That's SPEAKER_02: enough. SPEAKER_02: It was a weird time, wasn't it? SPEAKER_02: Looking back, it's so strange. SPEAKER_02: I remember talking to you and JJ about it SPEAKER_02: because that was when we would do the podcast SPEAKER_02: and record music for him in that SPEAKER_00: room. SPEAKER_02: And it was like, oh, 60 people either died SPEAKER_02: or got it or something. SPEAKER_02: And then I remember it was being like nine. SPEAKER_02: It's not gonna happen. SPEAKER_02: It's not gonna shut down things. SPEAKER_02: And then literally like a month later, SPEAKER_01: gone. SPEAKER_01: I remember I was supposed to go to Miami for Miami Ultra SPEAKER_01: and there's all these headlines SPEAKER_01: and surely they're just causing a scene, SPEAKER_01: gassing it up. SPEAKER_01: Headlines gotta be headlines. SPEAKER_01: And then literally the week before, SPEAKER_01: they were like boarded the shot. SPEAKER_01: I'm like, pain. SPEAKER_02: I think cause it's for us in our generation, SPEAKER_02: especially in the UK, not in the rest of the world. SPEAKER_02: There's never really been any like, SPEAKER_02: we hear about big news stories, SPEAKER_02: like hurricanes, tsunamis, pandemics, SPEAKER_02: but never really in the UK SPEAKER_02: have had anything wrong yourself. SPEAKER_02: So like when you read headlines, SPEAKER_02: you still think it's fake or like it's just a headline. SPEAKER_02: So you're like, oh, COVID, just on the news, SPEAKER_02: but probably it was real. SPEAKER_02: It became very real, man. SPEAKER_00: Well, like me, JJ, you and Josh all moved into London. SPEAKER_00: I don't know. SPEAKER_00: Like scammed. SPEAKER_00: Literally, like you got out of the house SPEAKER_00: like two months earlier than us, I think. SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so SPEAKER_01: I had one win for it. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: You were out of it. SPEAKER_00: And then we move into London SPEAKER_00: and it's literally like a month later, locked down. SPEAKER_00: And it just became like pointless. SPEAKER_00: I SPEAKER_01: did enjoy though, just walking around London. SPEAKER_01: Like I walked, I remember I walked all the way SPEAKER_01: from like down the River Thames, SPEAKER_01: past London Eye, past the House of Parliament, SPEAKER_01: back around down the other side of the river, walked home. SPEAKER_01: And I didn't see one single person. SPEAKER_01: That was the first week where it was like, SPEAKER_01: stay inside, do not go outside. SPEAKER_01: And as I was walking, I was like, SPEAKER_01: this will never happen again in my entire life. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah. SPEAKER_02: I remember thinking that. SPEAKER_02: And it got annoying as well when everything came back SPEAKER_02: because it like ruined London because it's so beautiful. SPEAKER_02: Yeah. SPEAKER_02: And now it's just fucking... SPEAKER_01: It was, yeah. SPEAKER_01: There were parts of London that were peaceful. SPEAKER_01: Anywhere I go in London now, it's just like... SPEAKER_01: You keep your head down. SPEAKER_01: You keep your head SPEAKER_02: down, you can't even look anymore. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, yeah. SPEAKER_02: Whereas back then it was like perspective and stuff. SPEAKER_02: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: We went and just looked at loads of old buildings. SPEAKER_01: Like that's all you could do. SPEAKER_01: You would just go and walk and look at things. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's SPEAKER_00: gonna happen. SPEAKER_00: Happens all the time. SPEAKER_02: I don't usually leave in. Unknown: Yeah. Unknown: It SPEAKER_00: stops in like 10 seconds. Unknown: If SPEAKER_01: you're Charlie Puth, you'd remix that. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, SPEAKER_02: yeah. SPEAKER_02: See my name? SPEAKER_00: And... SPEAKER_00: Stop. SPEAKER_00: Wait, before it's actually a lot off. SPEAKER_01: It's just about as cool. SPEAKER_01: The floor's getting kind of hot. SPEAKER_00: This is going on a bit long now. SPEAKER_00: I'm starting to worry. Unknown: Is that SPEAKER_00: number four? Unknown: No, SPEAKER_00: sure. SPEAKER_02: There we go. SPEAKER_00: There we go. Unknown: And... Unknown: Nice. SPEAKER_02: Class. SPEAKER_00: We've had that in side cast before, haven't we? SPEAKER_00: Really? Unknown: Yeah, SPEAKER_00: me and JJ went on a jog down Oxford Street SPEAKER_00: and it was literally, we saw six people. SPEAKER_00: But it was literally, you're going down the busiest street in London. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: And there's six people. SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's mad. SPEAKER_00: It was good. SPEAKER_00: Good SPEAKER_01: times. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: But I can't SPEAKER_00: wait to move into my house. SPEAKER_00: I'm like, I keep seeing, I feel like all of us SPEAKER_00: was so gasped to move into London. SPEAKER_00: And we're like, yeah, I want to live in central London SPEAKER_00: and experience all of that. SPEAKER_00: And now everyone just can't wait to be out of it. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah. SPEAKER_00: We did get scammed though. SPEAKER_00: Like, SPEAKER_02: you're all right. SPEAKER_02: So like, it did feel very like... SPEAKER_02: Although, SPEAKER_01: yeah. SPEAKER_01: At the same time though, actually, SPEAKER_01: it was kind of great for delivery food. SPEAKER_01: True. SPEAKER_01: I lived off like, Wickers restaurants were shut. SPEAKER_01: Like, so all you could do was order and food. SPEAKER_01: So I could just order and food nonstop, stream nonstop. SPEAKER_01: So I can't complain too much. SPEAKER_01: I mean, SPEAKER_00: it was great for like our career. SPEAKER_00: Oh, for us. SPEAKER_01: It was a good place to be, I think, actually. SPEAKER_00: Although, if we were in the house for lockdown, SPEAKER_00: it would have been lit. SPEAKER_00: Yeah, true. SPEAKER_00: Because we had a garden. SPEAKER_00: We had a pool. SPEAKER_00: We had a gym. SPEAKER_01: Content would have been nonsense. SPEAKER_01: But I would have been literally like, SPEAKER_01: let's film some videos on board. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: I think we would have... SPEAKER_00: I mean, yeah, both worked out kind of for us. Unknown: We SPEAKER_01: should have made more Sidemen gaming videos SPEAKER_01: during lockdown. SPEAKER_01: What will we do? SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah. SPEAKER_01: I think back, what will we actually do? Unknown: We SPEAKER_00: were just streaming. SPEAKER_00: It was... SPEAKER_00: Everyone was streaming. SPEAKER_00: But we should have SPEAKER_01: just streamed games together SPEAKER_01: and recorded it. SPEAKER_02: True. SPEAKER_02: It's kind of good though. SPEAKER_02: In a way, like, actually, the first one, SPEAKER_02: I mean, everyone kind of says the first one felt good. SPEAKER_02: Obviously, it was bad, like, for the world. SPEAKER_02: But like... SPEAKER_02: No, I mean, I agree. SPEAKER_02: I know what you mean. SPEAKER_02: Because you just wake up and just fucking game all day SPEAKER_02: and not feel bad. SPEAKER_02: Yeah. SPEAKER_02: Because the thing is, you'd feel bad, right? SPEAKER_02: You'd say, oh, I should probably do something properly now. SPEAKER_02: Before you would never do it, man. SPEAKER_02: Just go for it. SPEAKER_02: It's like, sick. SPEAKER_02: But yeah. SPEAKER_02: But the house has been good. SPEAKER_01: No. SPEAKER_01: It's very nice. SPEAKER_02: Have you still got rooms that you don't use? SPEAKER_02: Yes. SPEAKER_02: And how does that feel? SPEAKER_02: Because for me, that's kind of like weird, like... SPEAKER_02: Yeah. SPEAKER_02: Because also, I'm slowly filling in the furniture. SPEAKER_02: I'm not rushing it. SPEAKER_02: I don't need to get everything done. SPEAKER_02: So like, some places are just still empty. SPEAKER_02: It's really weird. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, there's SPEAKER_01: a few empty rooms, but it was good SPEAKER_01: because we had loads of people staying with us, SPEAKER_01: like around... SPEAKER_01: Why did everyone come here? SPEAKER_01: Just at one point... SPEAKER_01: Charity match and boxing. SPEAKER_00: Did you just boxing? SPEAKER_02: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: Or charity match? SPEAKER_01: It was not. SPEAKER_01: It was because we went to Tomorrowland. SPEAKER_01: Okay. SPEAKER_01: And it also happened to... SPEAKER_01: Because that's when Lachlan came, Rob came. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: Some of Ellie's friends from overseas came. SPEAKER_01: Nice. SPEAKER_01: And like, we had like a full house. SPEAKER_01: It was... SPEAKER_01: Long time, right? SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: And then Lannan just stayed because he couldn't get a visa. SPEAKER_01: Oh, he's been here for ages, right? SPEAKER_01: He came back and forth. SPEAKER_01: He was here. SPEAKER_01: He was here for about... SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he's not here now. SPEAKER_01: No, no, no, no. SPEAKER_01: It was good to go and see him. SPEAKER_01: I was like, I'm staying at your house now. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, true, true. SPEAKER_01: In my SPEAKER_00: head, your house, like... SPEAKER_00: Because you know you did your house tour? SPEAKER_00: Mm-hmm. SPEAKER_00: And it was quite empty at that point. SPEAKER_00: In my house, in my head, it's still that. SPEAKER_00: It's still fair. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: Obviously. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: No, there's like 25% done. SPEAKER_01: It's getting there. SPEAKER_01: It's a very... SPEAKER_01: We've been quite meh, getting it done. SPEAKER_01: It's one of those things where it's just... SPEAKER_01: You just kind of like, you forget to follow up on stuff SPEAKER_01: and then just nothing happens. SPEAKER_02: Well, it's because you live in the parts that you live in. SPEAKER_02: That's it. SPEAKER_02: And like, you don't need the stuff necessarily. SPEAKER_02: You just need to look good. SPEAKER_02: Or if you have guests around and stuff. SPEAKER_02: So it's like, I don't need a sofa just for the room. SPEAKER_02: I don't go in it. SPEAKER_02: Yeah. SPEAKER_02: But it looks weird without one. SPEAKER_01: I would say everything is functional. SPEAKER_01: The full house is functional. SPEAKER_01: But in terms of decoration and like filling spaces. SPEAKER_01: It's still a long way. SPEAKER_01: Cause I was supposed to do a video like this year. SPEAKER_01: I was like, this is everything I've done. SPEAKER_01: It's like, that was last summer. SPEAKER_01: Like a new house tour. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: A new house tour. SPEAKER_01: I'm like, maybe next year. SPEAKER_01: Give me another year. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: Well, you've got your gym. SPEAKER_00: The gym is fully done. SPEAKER_00: The gym. SPEAKER_00: I'm very, very happy SPEAKER_01: with that. SPEAKER_01: I spend, yeah. SPEAKER_01: A lot of time in there. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: Instead of making videos. SPEAKER_01: I'm just in the gym. SPEAKER_01: In the gym, man. SPEAKER_00: In the gym. SPEAKER_00: It does look really sick. SPEAKER_00: I remember watching that video. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: It's really, SPEAKER_01: it's nice as well. SPEAKER_01: Cause it's a, I just enjoy being there. SPEAKER_01: So like, I can go and spend like two hours just like sat in there. SPEAKER_01: Just like being really lazy and slow with my workout. SPEAKER_01: But it's just somewhere I want to be. SPEAKER_01: Like put some music, turn down the lights. Unknown: Cause SPEAKER_02: you feel sometimes for me, like going to the gym is always like the SPEAKER_02: long part. SPEAKER_02: Like actually getting out and going. SPEAKER_02: And it's SPEAKER_01: finding the gap in the day. SPEAKER_01: Like, so sometimes you'll think, right, I've got 50 minutes. SPEAKER_01: It's going to take me 10 minutes to get to the gym. SPEAKER_01: Then 10 minutes to get back. SPEAKER_01: So then I'll have 30 minutes to gym. SPEAKER_01: What's the point? SPEAKER_01: Where it's like, I can kind of be like working on stuff. SPEAKER_01: Like if I know I've got a delivery coming or something. SPEAKER_01: I'll be like, right, I'm going to go and start my workout. SPEAKER_01: I'll stop for five minutes in the middle. SPEAKER_01: Go back to it. SPEAKER_02: My dad's currently putting my gym floor in my garage. SPEAKER_00: Damn. SPEAKER_02: Labor. SPEAKER_02: But also gym equipment is way more offensive than I thought it was. SPEAKER_01: Oh yeah. SPEAKER_01: It went up during lockdown. SPEAKER_01: I feel like it's been up during lockdown. SPEAKER_01: So many people wanted home gym equipment. SPEAKER_01: The prices went up and they just left the prices. SPEAKER_01: They're just like, you know, you're right. SPEAKER_01: We're kind of rich now. SPEAKER_01: Leave the prices up. SPEAKER_02: Is that the AC? SPEAKER_02: Even the AC is cool coordinated. SPEAKER_01: It was white. SPEAKER_01: They wrapped it. SPEAKER_01: That's rad. SPEAKER_02: That's so sick, man. SPEAKER_02: Yeah. SPEAKER_02: But the treadmill was like three grand. SPEAKER_02: I'm like, fuck, man. Unknown: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: I still have the one Simon bought me. SPEAKER_01: That was SPEAKER_02: a Simon video. SPEAKER_02: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: And I SPEAKER_01: still haven't activated the Peloton membership. SPEAKER_01: I don't want it. SPEAKER_01: I just want to run. SPEAKER_01: True. SPEAKER_02: I was thinking that. SPEAKER_02: I was looking at the different between Peloton and regular one. SPEAKER_02: I'm like, am I just paying for the bloke to tell me what to do? SPEAKER_01: I personally, I just don't. SPEAKER_01: I just want, but it has a setting where you just press just run. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: And you can set the incline and speed. SPEAKER_01: And that's all I want to do. SPEAKER_01: I stick an iPad. SPEAKER_01: It has this massive screen. SPEAKER_01: And I just have an iPad on the massive screen. SPEAKER_01: With like whatever I'm watching on it. SPEAKER_02: But I'm like, SPEAKER_01: it's crazy. SPEAKER_01: It's like an exp... SPEAKER_01: It's one of the most expensive treadmills. SPEAKER_01: And then you pay them like 40 quid a month or something on top. SPEAKER_01: I swear it's a scam. SPEAKER_01: But the thing is other people are like, yeah, I love how I do the classes. SPEAKER_01: That's the thing. SPEAKER_01: I know that Conn does, SPEAKER_00: I think. SPEAKER_00: Conn said that he uses like the other stuff, SPEAKER_00: like he'll just put it onto the TV, SPEAKER_00: like a different TV and do the classes. SPEAKER_02: It's a different treadmill type thing. SPEAKER_00: No, no. SPEAKER_00: So you can literally do like a yoga class on a different TV. SPEAKER_00: All right. SPEAKER_00: So I think it is worth it. SPEAKER_00: If you... SPEAKER_00: If that SPEAKER_01: is how you work out, SPEAKER_01: but for me, I'm just... SPEAKER_01: If you want to just run. SPEAKER_01: I live here. SPEAKER_01: There's no point. SPEAKER_01: That's it. SPEAKER_00: Well, speaking of Simon videos. SPEAKER_01: Yes. SPEAKER_00: The video that went out. SPEAKER_00: This is next week. SPEAKER_00: Okay. SPEAKER_00: So. SPEAKER_00: Young versus old just went out. SPEAKER_01: Young guns. SPEAKER_00: Me and Vic were on the young team. SPEAKER_00: You haven't seen it because it's not out yet. SPEAKER_01: I've seen some clips. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: Of the old team. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: Okay. SPEAKER_00: We were on the young team and it started off a bit stinky. SPEAKER_00: We went to kids zone. SPEAKER_00: Right. SPEAKER_00: I've been there before for... SPEAKER_00: When you were a kid. SPEAKER_00: And also another video. SPEAKER_01: Oh. SPEAKER_01: That same exact place or just... SPEAKER_01: It was a different one. SPEAKER_01: Okay. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: But then we went to white water rafting. SPEAKER_00: Oh. SPEAKER_00: And it was me, him, Toby and JJ. SPEAKER_00: They shouldn't... SPEAKER_01: Actually, you know what? SPEAKER_01: They shouldn't have done it. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: I'm very mixed. SPEAKER_01: I was just about to say they should have done it, SPEAKER_01: but then I actually realized how mad those rapids were. SPEAKER_00: Who's they? SPEAKER_00: JJ and Toby didn't do it. SPEAKER_00: Right. SPEAKER_00: Okay. SPEAKER_00: So me and Vic went in. SPEAKER_00: It was me and Vic in front of us, SPEAKER_00: two instructors who, you know, SPEAKER_00: literally do every day. SPEAKER_00: Instructor. SPEAKER_00: Behind us, the like, SPEAKER_00: the main instructor who kind of controls it all. SPEAKER_00: It was meant to be him, me, Vic, JJ, Toby. SPEAKER_01: That would have been... SPEAKER_01: That would have been so funny. SPEAKER_00: It literally... SPEAKER_00: It didn't end well. SPEAKER_00: We went down it once, SPEAKER_00: went around the whole thing. SPEAKER_00: You have to start off. SPEAKER_00: You have to jump into the water. SPEAKER_00: Okay. SPEAKER_00: And then kind of just slide down. SPEAKER_01: See how, yeah. SPEAKER_01: Feel what it feels like to be in the water. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: And then we went down at the second time SPEAKER_00: and we kind of turn around on the rapids SPEAKER_00: and try and like... SPEAKER_01: Balance, basically. SPEAKER_01: Balance in the swell. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: I didn't really get it. SPEAKER_01: So that, I think what that is is like, SPEAKER_01: I think, I know expert, SPEAKER_01: but I think in water rafting, SPEAKER_01: it's important to be able to like SPEAKER_01: control where you are SPEAKER_01: and if you need to be able to kind of SPEAKER_01: hold your position on the rapids. SPEAKER_01: Okay. SPEAKER_01: I don't know. SPEAKER_01: I don't know why. SPEAKER_01: Maybe that's like a log. SPEAKER_01: I don't know. SPEAKER_01: It's fallen in front of you. SPEAKER_01: Actually, I'm making... SPEAKER_02: I'm SPEAKER_01: completely... SPEAKER_01: It sounds good. SPEAKER_01: It sounds really good. SPEAKER_01: It seems like there is a reason SPEAKER_01: to be able to try and hold yourself SPEAKER_01: and start your point. SPEAKER_01: So we're trying to teach us to do that. SPEAKER_00: So it was... SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: So we turn around SPEAKER_00: and then we go into the rapids SPEAKER_00: and the guy's like, SPEAKER_00: lean left. SPEAKER_00: I mean, if you have to lean left. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: Really right. SPEAKER_00: Keep doing that. SPEAKER_00: And eventually we started tipping a lot. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: And then they basically, SPEAKER_00: the whole thing just flipped. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: And we ended up... SPEAKER_00: I ended up under the raft. SPEAKER_00: I didn't see what happened to you. SPEAKER_00: I didn't hit SPEAKER_01: myself in the chin SPEAKER_01: with my awe. SPEAKER_00: He told you to hold on. SPEAKER_00: But SPEAKER_01: when Unknown: you're flipping. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: And then, yeah, SPEAKER_00: we just got sent down and... SPEAKER_00: It was fun though. SPEAKER_00: I actually really enjoyed it. SPEAKER_00: I did really SPEAKER_01: enjoy it. SPEAKER_01: Because the fact that you went in SPEAKER_02: on your own first to feel it out, SPEAKER_02: like when you fall in, SPEAKER_02: it's like same as that, right? SPEAKER_02: Yeah. SPEAKER_02: It was... SPEAKER_02: Without the canoe on your head SPEAKER_02: or whatever you're on. SPEAKER_02: Yeah. SPEAKER_02: It's a great way to play it SPEAKER_02: while we're off. SPEAKER_02: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: Doing that in an actual, like, SPEAKER_01: plastic canoe, SPEAKER_01: I think I would die. SPEAKER_01: I would just get stuck upside down. SPEAKER_01: After the round. SPEAKER_00: I actually have done that. SPEAKER_00: Really? SPEAKER_00: White water off the canoe. SPEAKER_00: White water in the... SPEAKER_00: In a canoe, yeah. SPEAKER_00: In a solo canoe. SPEAKER_02: We had two of us. SPEAKER_02: Okay. SPEAKER_02: It was PGL. SPEAKER_02: I was in, like, year six. SPEAKER_00: Are they quite... SPEAKER_00: Were they quite big rapids? SPEAKER_02: Yeah. SPEAKER_02: They have decent SPEAKER_01: size. SPEAKER_01: They're sick. Unknown: It SPEAKER_01: doesn't sound safe. SPEAKER_01: But then again, SPEAKER_01: when we were kids, SPEAKER_01: health and safety... SPEAKER_01: True. SPEAKER_01: True, true. SPEAKER_01: It's like PGL, SPEAKER_02: which I'm pretty sure SPEAKER_02: is stuff like parents get lost, right? SPEAKER_02: I don't know what SPEAKER_01: PGL is. SPEAKER_01: Oh. SPEAKER_01: It's like a school trip SPEAKER_01: when I was sick, though. SPEAKER_02: So good, man. SPEAKER_02: Is it a time in the age where, like, SPEAKER_02: you know when you do something SPEAKER_02: pairs at school SPEAKER_02: and you're picking partners? SPEAKER_02: And then we had this friend SPEAKER_02: and I was like, SPEAKER_02: Rahm, I'll be with you, right? SPEAKER_02: Dynamic duo. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah. SPEAKER_02: And then someone else asked him, SPEAKER_02: can I be in your team? SPEAKER_02: I'm with Andrew. SPEAKER_02: I'm with Big Randy. SPEAKER_02: You're going to get a fuckmail SPEAKER_02: or shit. SPEAKER_02: I'm with a loser kid, man. SPEAKER_01: Like Squid Game, SPEAKER_01: where they just die. SPEAKER_01: I'm sorry.

SPEAKER_02: It's not just swimming, SPEAKER_00: you know. SPEAKER_00: Well, when we jumped in SPEAKER_00: and then when we went down SPEAKER_00: the first time SPEAKER_00: and it was very calm, SPEAKER_00: I was thinking, SPEAKER_00: you know, SPEAKER_00: like you should have done this. SPEAKER_01: I think it was very calm, though, SPEAKER_01: because we had three SPEAKER_01: professional white water rappers SPEAKER_01: with us. SPEAKER_01: But SPEAKER_00: I think the guy behind us SPEAKER_00: could have done it on his own. SPEAKER_00: Bro, Donny was like, SPEAKER_00: yeah. SPEAKER_00: Or is up SPEAKER_00: and then he's just doing it himself. SPEAKER_00: True. SPEAKER_00: And I think SPEAKER_00: we would have struggled a bit, but... SPEAKER_01: Yeah, true. SPEAKER_01: He would have always kept it. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: Okay. SPEAKER_00: But I think the last one, SPEAKER_00: 100%, SPEAKER_00: they would have had a terrible time. SPEAKER_01: They would have actually SPEAKER_01: thought they were going to die. SPEAKER_00: Good content. SPEAKER_00: Like, yeah. SPEAKER_00: True. SPEAKER_00: JD would SPEAKER_02: have had good content then. SPEAKER_02: But you also, SPEAKER_02: have you got your face painted? Unknown: I SPEAKER_00: did, yeah. SPEAKER_02: That was... SPEAKER_02: Also, he turned up SPEAKER_02: when the podcast last week SPEAKER_02: with Nathan Dore. SPEAKER_02: My guy turns up with like SPEAKER_02: eyeliner on. SPEAKER_02: Do you look like Young Mentor? SPEAKER_02: Bro, SPEAKER_00: ever since that.",

SPEAKER_00: The only thing about Valorant is it's much slower Unknown: in SPEAKER_00: terms of like you, SPEAKER_00: because obviously it's like one life, SPEAKER_00: you literally kind of go in SPEAKER_00: and then you have one battle when you're out. SPEAKER_00: Whereas Overwatch, you're literally like, SPEAKER_00: you respawn, just run in. SPEAKER_00: Run back, run back. SPEAKER_00: But each hero has got a different SPEAKER_02: gun though, right? SPEAKER_02: On Overwatch or is it all the same? SPEAKER_02: They've all got different guns. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, okay. SPEAKER_02: But I mean, SPEAKER_00: you literally just press fire SPEAKER_00: and you can pretty much tell what it is and stuff. SPEAKER_00: Oh, SPEAKER_02: I'll give it a go. SPEAKER_02: I haven't played like 10 minutes, turned off. SPEAKER_02: Stressed me out, man. SPEAKER_02: Everyone in the chat was like, SPEAKER_02: you don't even do anything like 10 minutes. SPEAKER_02: You didn't do any damage. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah. SPEAKER_02: I killed one guy finally, but... SPEAKER_02: You think? SPEAKER_02: I think, yeah. SPEAKER_02: Let's not cross the map with Winston. SPEAKER_02: But the gaming world is dry though. SPEAKER_02: I feel like there's no games, man. SPEAKER_02: I feel bad for some streamers. SPEAKER_02: Like what are they doing? SPEAKER_02: Yeah, SPEAKER_01: or even gaming YouTubers SPEAKER_01: but it's gaming streamers. SPEAKER_00: Or the cod. SPEAKER_00: Cod. SPEAKER_00: By the time this comes out, SPEAKER_00: cod is out. SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. SPEAKER_00: Multiplayer, yeah. SPEAKER_00: You gonna get on it? SPEAKER_01: Probably not multiplayer. SPEAKER_01: I think I will actually probably need to though SPEAKER_01: to get stuff for Warzone, right? SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah. SPEAKER_02: That was the smartest thing they did SPEAKER_02: for actual 2019 Warzone. SPEAKER_02: Yeah. SPEAKER_02: So many people bought. SPEAKER_02: They did, yeah. SPEAKER_02: You buy SPEAKER_01: every cod to get guns. SPEAKER_01: Because otherwise, what SPEAKER_02: was it? SPEAKER_02: Plumit? SPEAKER_02: Was it SPEAKER_01: plunder? SPEAKER_02: Plunder. SPEAKER_02: And that SPEAKER_01: was sick though SPEAKER_01: when you could do helicopter contract. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah. SPEAKER_01: You do the supply runs SPEAKER_01: and you'd max a gun in like two hours. SPEAKER_01: And then they packed that SPEAKER_01: and I was like, no. SPEAKER_01: No, you're like. SPEAKER_01: No, I'm SPEAKER_00: sad. SPEAKER_00: I feel like I'm the only person SPEAKER_00: that I've met SPEAKER_00: that really has enjoyed cod multiplayer SPEAKER_00: for the last three years. SPEAKER_00: Because SPEAKER_01: you didn't play like the originals. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you didn't rinse the originals. SPEAKER_01: Like I put like probably 70 days SPEAKER_01: into like cod 4, World at War, SPEAKER_01: Modern Warfare 2, Black Ops 1, SPEAKER_01: Black Ops 2. SPEAKER_01: So I'm just... SPEAKER_01: Black SPEAKER_00: Ops 1 I did. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: But I think that was it. SPEAKER_00: Modern Warfare 2 was the one SPEAKER_00: that I got into. SPEAKER_00: We should bring back SPEAKER_01: more Sidemen, SPEAKER_01: cod wager matches. SPEAKER_01: I hope they have them SPEAKER_01: in Modern Warfare 2. SPEAKER_01: I don't think they will SPEAKER_01: because it was more of a... SPEAKER_01: Wager matches SPEAKER_00: were the... Unknown: They SPEAKER_01: were in Black Ops. SPEAKER_00: This is the one where you like... SPEAKER_00: Sticks and stones. SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. SPEAKER_00: That was JJ's one in the chamber. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: And I used to get SPEAKER_01: to the last gun on a gun game SPEAKER_01: and just knife everyone. SPEAKER_01: Just put them back. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, set them back. SPEAKER_00: Oh, that's like...",

SPEAKER_02: They put me and Castro on like 1v1 SPEAKER_02: and the loser gets slimed. SPEAKER_02: So obviously I got slimed SPEAKER_02: because the guy plays it like a living.

SPEAKER_02: I mean, back in the day is better than me, SPEAKER_02: but I mean, SPEAKER_02: he still will beat me now. SPEAKER_02: I'm not great, but it's not hard. SPEAKER_02: Although he stopped playing. SPEAKER_02: Has he? SPEAKER_02: No, I watch. SPEAKER_00: He was, he was bagging the game out SPEAKER_00: and he was like, yeah, I'm into six.

SPEAKER_02: Is the new FIFA out? SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: It came out at the end of September. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: They recorded clubs the other day. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: I mean, SPEAKER_00: Oh, you weren't there. SPEAKER_00: No, no, no. SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it was. SPEAKER_01: Harry said he didn't enjoy it, which is SPEAKER_01: apparently Harry doesn't SPEAKER_00: like clubs. SPEAKER_01: Oh, SPEAKER_00: because whenever we've recorded, SPEAKER_00: it's like, SPEAKER_00: you don't enjoy clubs much. SPEAKER_00: Like it's fun, SPEAKER_00: but it's okay. SPEAKER_00: It's not your. SPEAKER_00: Well, SPEAKER_01: actually, SPEAKER_01: I don't enjoy as much as it just doesn't. SPEAKER_01: It's, SPEAKER_01: I think the videos are good, SPEAKER_01: but they just don't do well. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: And that's what, SPEAKER_01: that's what it, SPEAKER_01: because it takes probably more time SPEAKER_01: to record that than something. SPEAKER_01: 100%. SPEAKER_01: And then when it doesn't do as well, SPEAKER_01: I'm like, SPEAKER_01: okay. SPEAKER_00: It's because it was, SPEAKER_00: I feel like it was like an iconic SPEAKER_00: more Sidemen series. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: And then it just fell off. SPEAKER_00: It was an SPEAKER_01: iconic Sidemen channel series. SPEAKER_01: It was the first series SPEAKER_01: we started on the Sidemen channel. SPEAKER_00: And then it just, yeah, SPEAKER_00: it fell off like among us is now SPEAKER_00: like a classic Sidemen series. SPEAKER_00: But yeah, SPEAKER_00: then Harry apparently doesn't enjoy clubs. SPEAKER_00: I Unknown: heard SPEAKER_02: it SPEAKER_00: through the grapevine. SPEAKER_00: Wow. SPEAKER_00: I was confused. SPEAKER_02: There you go. SPEAKER_02: Yeah. SPEAKER_02: Simon fans are crying. Unknown: How could he? SPEAKER_00: Well, yeah. SPEAKER_00: I don't think clubs SPEAKER_00: is coming back anytime soon now. SPEAKER_00: I'm SPEAKER_01: not complaining. SPEAKER_01: I feel like, SPEAKER_01: I feel like there's so much we can do SPEAKER_01: with that channel. SPEAKER_00: 100%. Unknown: I SPEAKER_01: think SPEAKER_00: it's actually, SPEAKER_00: it hurts me knowing that obviously SPEAKER_00: you posted so many videos SPEAKER_00: over the year, SPEAKER_00: like over so many years. SPEAKER_00: So have I. SPEAKER_00: So has Josh. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: So has Ethan. SPEAKER_00: And we can't get more Sidemen posting. SPEAKER_00: Like we struggle with SPEAKER_00: two or three weeks. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: We would do recordings, SPEAKER_01: but it was our whole life. SPEAKER_01: It was. SPEAKER_01: We would wake up to record SPEAKER_01: for four hours to edit the video, SPEAKER_01: to post them, SPEAKER_01: to do it again the next day. SPEAKER_01: Even SPEAKER_00: still, SPEAKER_00: we would record for, SPEAKER_00: yeah, four hours. SPEAKER_00: Now, SPEAKER_00: we record for like two hours SPEAKER_00: and people's attention spans have gone. SPEAKER_01: It was so much easier back then as well SPEAKER_01: because we just had to record the content SPEAKER_01: and make the content good. SPEAKER_01: And I was posting SPEAKER_01: GTA episode 432. SPEAKER_01: Now you need the title. SPEAKER_01: Now you need the title and the thumbnail SPEAKER_01: or no one's going to click it. SPEAKER_01: So it was a different time. SPEAKER_01: We were able to do that. SPEAKER_01: We could record so much volume, SPEAKER_01: but it doesn't, SPEAKER_01: it's not about recording volume SPEAKER_01: on YouTube at the moment. Unknown: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: But still, I think like, SPEAKER_00: I think we like, SPEAKER_00: some of us have gone through the phase of SPEAKER_00: just grinding for 12 hours a day. SPEAKER_00: We could sit there SPEAKER_00: and if we had the ideas there. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: Would you happily like, SPEAKER_00: would you happily sit there? SPEAKER_00: You go one day. SPEAKER_00: I'd spend six hours SPEAKER_01: recording gaming SPEAKER_01: for more Sidemen. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: So long as everything works, SPEAKER_01: so long SPEAKER_00: as it's that way. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_02: And if you enjoy the games as well, SPEAKER_02: it goes by really quick. SPEAKER_02: If you enjoy the game, SPEAKER_02: it's like just drags. SPEAKER_02: And also SPEAKER_00: if, yeah, SPEAKER_00: if something doesn't work SPEAKER_00: like the Among Us mod. SPEAKER_00: The second that happened SPEAKER_00: and we spent two hours. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: That's sick thumbnails. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: But then when thumbnails didn't matter. SPEAKER_01: Short and sweet clips. SPEAKER_01: Short and sweet clips, bro. SPEAKER_01: Do SPEAKER_00: you think, right, SPEAKER_00: if say you were doing these videos SPEAKER_00: 11 years ago. SPEAKER_00: Yes. SPEAKER_00: And you had today's thumbnails. SPEAKER_00: Do you think people would, SPEAKER_00: like they would do way better? Unknown: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: I'm just, SPEAKER_01: I don't know what's happening. SPEAKER_01: It's all right. SPEAKER_00: Rain in care packages. SPEAKER_00: I think we SPEAKER_01: crashed. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: I think we crashed them. SPEAKER_01: Oh my God. SPEAKER_01: I love this fucking game.

SPEAKER_00: But you have to SPEAKER_01: do enough and you have to create SPEAKER_01: the right parameters for stuff to go right. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: And then sometimes, yeah, SPEAKER_01: you have videos where like an example being SPEAKER_01: the Mr. Beast video, SPEAKER_01: that nothing remarkable happened in that video. SPEAKER_01: True. SPEAKER_01: Perhaps Nolan guessing like four doors in a row. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: That was pretty like, whoa. SPEAKER_01: But beyond that, SPEAKER_01: not a single remarkable thing happened in that video. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: It could have, SPEAKER_01: but it just didn't. SPEAKER_01: And a lot of people will be like, SPEAKER_01: oh, you know, SPEAKER_01: something used to be so much funnier SPEAKER_01: when something else happened. SPEAKER_01: But it's just like, SPEAKER_01: sometimes stuff just doesn't happen that way. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: If you rely on, SPEAKER_00: if you rely on something that is like a one take thing, SPEAKER_00: you just have to hope that it goes right. SPEAKER_00: Like the total wipeout we did SPEAKER_00: where Ethan almost broke his back. SPEAKER_00: It's like, SPEAKER_00: I know that went wrong, SPEAKER_00: but it went right for content. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: Now he's fine. SPEAKER_00: It's like, SPEAKER_02: There's all ball, SPEAKER_02: like him getting hit with that. SPEAKER_02: Yeah. SPEAKER_02: Even the, SPEAKER_02: the whole in a war video. SPEAKER_02: I was just about to say that one. SPEAKER_02: Like JJ just like went crazy and it worked. SPEAKER_02: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: Him doing water, man. SPEAKER_01: It wasn't planned. SPEAKER_00: He wasn't meant to even wear the thing. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: It was like a bandana here SPEAKER_00: and he was just going to wear it normally SPEAKER_00: and then Toby put it on his own face. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: And then we were like, SPEAKER_00: Oh, it'd be funny for JJ SPEAKER_00: because his hair will stick out the top. Unknown: And SPEAKER_01: now he's on the top skirt. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: And that SPEAKER_00: character is like, SPEAKER_00: one of the funniest ones he's ever done. SPEAKER_00: I actually really SPEAKER_02: want that card, SPEAKER_02: by the way. SPEAKER_02: I'm checking EV for that card. SPEAKER_02: Scouring. SPEAKER_02: Yeah. SPEAKER_02: They all got SPEAKER_01: water, man. SPEAKER_02: Right. SPEAKER_02: I'll buy it from you. SPEAKER_02: It looks fucking sick. SPEAKER_02: It's sick. SPEAKER_02: Even because it's got like a pink background SPEAKER_02: as well. SPEAKER_02: It just looks really good. SPEAKER_02: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: So many things like that. SPEAKER_01: Also in that video, SPEAKER_01: one of my favorite moments of that whole video, SPEAKER_01: it's when JJ had to line his back SPEAKER_01: with his legs up in the air. SPEAKER_01: And Andrew. SPEAKER_01: That was the first one. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: And the first one, SPEAKER_01: and that was so easy to do. SPEAKER_01: You just measure where your legs need to be. SPEAKER_01: You stick them up. SPEAKER_01: The wall would have gone past him. SPEAKER_01: No one would have laughed. SPEAKER_01: It would have been like, SPEAKER_01: Oh, nice. SPEAKER_01: Good job. SPEAKER_01: Instead, SPEAKER_01: he gets his legs too wide. SPEAKER_01: He gets folded over backwards. SPEAKER_01: It was so slow as well. SPEAKER_01: And it's hysterical. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: That's content. SPEAKER_01: You just have to create the parameters. SPEAKER_01: I want to watch it again. SPEAKER_01: It's so slow. SPEAKER_01: I've actually watched the video SPEAKER_01: like three times. SPEAKER_02: It's crazy. SPEAKER_01: He SPEAKER_00: gets folded in. SPEAKER_01: Oh, good watch that one. SPEAKER_01: And then there's Ethan, SPEAKER_02: holding his nose SPEAKER_02: and then letting go SPEAKER_02: when he actually goes in the water. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: When he does the bomb onto the platform. SPEAKER_00: So good. SPEAKER_00: I think it might be that spike. SPEAKER_00: It's right at the end. SPEAKER_00: It's very close to the end. SPEAKER_00: What's that spike though? SPEAKER_01: Oh, this was a disaster. SPEAKER_01: Oh, this SPEAKER_00: was, yeah. SPEAKER_00: This was bad. SPEAKER_00: It's just the wrong way. SPEAKER_00: No, Toby jumps. SPEAKER_00: I rate SPEAKER_01: Toby for trying. SPEAKER_00: But he jumps and ruins it. SPEAKER_00: See, I see. SPEAKER_01: JJ's head. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: That's what I thought. SPEAKER_00: I got messed up with my back. SPEAKER_00: And then you go to the end. SPEAKER_00: I think it is. SPEAKER_00: There's W. SPEAKER_00: Just check the spikes. SPEAKER_00: No, no. SPEAKER_00: Is Unknown: it SPEAKER_01: the end? SPEAKER_01: He's doing it there. SPEAKER_01: The one before. SPEAKER_01: That SPEAKER_00: one. Unknown: Yeah, SPEAKER_00: because they both failed. SPEAKER_00: So we're like, you have to go in. Unknown: Is SPEAKER_01: this where he tries to see it drop through Unknown: the... Unknown: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: He tries to jump onto the thing SPEAKER_00: and he holds his nose. SPEAKER_00: And then falls SPEAKER_01: off. SPEAKER_01: Holds his nose. SPEAKER_00: Let's go. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that video did really well. SPEAKER_01: I mean, it did really well. SPEAKER_01: It was all right. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: Fortunately, yeah. SPEAKER_01: Because that could have been one that was big budget SPEAKER_01: and just didn't go anywhere. SPEAKER_01: But SPEAKER_00: we only found out on the day as well. SPEAKER_00: Did you see how there's a big gap underneath it? SPEAKER_00: It wasn't meant to be there at all. SPEAKER_00: But they basically just did it and said SPEAKER_00: there has to be a gap. SPEAKER_00: Otherwise the thing will scrape and break. SPEAKER_00: So it kind of messed us up a bit. SPEAKER_00: It was way bigger than it should have been. SPEAKER_00: It's a way SPEAKER_01: to cut some bits off. SPEAKER_01: No. SPEAKER_00: Between the bottom of SPEAKER_01: the board and the floor. SPEAKER_01: Oh, okay. SPEAKER_01: And it was actually really bad SPEAKER_01: because the shapes were designed SPEAKER_01: so that you would fit in them if you were at the bottom. SPEAKER_01: So it was like just a slight mess up really. SPEAKER_00: So it's like if I'm meant to stand like this, SPEAKER_00: the head piece, because it's moved up SPEAKER_00: because of that, is now here. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: So I have to awkwardly try and jump. SPEAKER_00: We always had to jump for all of it. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: And if we were trying to do it seriously, SPEAKER_01: we would have said this is not going to work. SPEAKER_01: We can't compete in this game. SPEAKER_01: No way. SPEAKER_01: But instead we literally just got knocked in SPEAKER_01: and just failed with everything. SPEAKER_01: It was a better video. SPEAKER_01: So you see where SPEAKER_00: mine is, how it's my head. SPEAKER_00: I'm meant to be, that's meant to be on the floor. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: But obviously it's like a yard above. SPEAKER_01: That's mad. SPEAKER_01: That one worked out better. SPEAKER_01: He hit me SPEAKER_00: square in the head. Unknown: You SPEAKER_02: were freezing in the video. SPEAKER_00: Josh had a win. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: Josh had W host. SPEAKER_00: Well, to be fair though, SPEAKER_00: he actually really wanted to do it. SPEAKER_00: Hole in the wall is one that he was wanting. SPEAKER_00: He was like, hole in the wall be sick SPEAKER_00: like it's won the game show. SPEAKER_00: He could have got SPEAKER_01: a guest. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: He didn't want that wall. SPEAKER_00: True. SPEAKER_00: That SPEAKER_01: was SPEAKER_00: freezing. SPEAKER_01: I see. Unknown: Do SPEAKER_00: you prefer the big shoots or like the smaller shoots? SPEAKER_00: Because me and Josh realized the holiday videos, SPEAKER_00: both of them, the two biggest videos, SPEAKER_00: neither of them we had a cameraman. Unknown: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: Even the Europe one where we went to Benidorm. SPEAKER_00: We had a security line. SPEAKER_00: That was it. SPEAKER_01: Mad. SPEAKER_00: Jon's out of a job. SPEAKER_01: Two questions there, I guess. SPEAKER_01: I prefer the more loosely formatted videos. SPEAKER_01: My favorite videos are like the traveling ones SPEAKER_01: where you get to do stuff. SPEAKER_01: You just go with the flow. SPEAKER_01: I don't think it makes a difference SPEAKER_01: whether we have camera people or cameras ourselves SPEAKER_01: because I think we're now at the point where SPEAKER_01: we'll miss things if we're having to vlog it ourselves SPEAKER_01: because we just don't have that same mindset. SPEAKER_01: I think it's good to have a combo of both SPEAKER_01: but it's also really nice. SPEAKER_01: There are some things like, for example, SPEAKER_01: in the Europe calories video, SPEAKER_01: me, Harry and Lana are literally sprinting SPEAKER_01: to try and find out where this hot air balloon is landing. SPEAKER_01: We would have struggled to vlog that kind of thing. SPEAKER_01: So it's nice sometimes just knowing SPEAKER_01: that you can do what you do SPEAKER_01: and I feel like you actually get better content SPEAKER_01: for having it shot for you. Unknown: Yes. SPEAKER_01: There we go. SPEAKER_01: Jon celebrates. SPEAKER_01: So, yeah, that's... SPEAKER_01: I prefer having cameras SPEAKER_01: and my favorites, yeah, SPEAKER_01: they're going out there. SPEAKER_01: I'm stressed by big studio videos SPEAKER_01: because I've had two big ones SPEAKER_01: that I've been partial organizer of. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, the missed beast. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah. SPEAKER_01: And then the next week's video SPEAKER_01: was a big one. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah. SPEAKER_01: So Unknown: maybe SPEAKER_01: let's chill out for a bit. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I remember Ethan was really stressed as well SPEAKER_02: for the escape rooms, right? SPEAKER_02: Yeah, SPEAKER_01: that was a tough one. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, because SPEAKER_02: you couldn't see them, right? SPEAKER_02: So he's like a combination of like... SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Unknown: He SPEAKER_02: can organize them, but you can't actually see them SPEAKER_02: because he's looking at the answer. SPEAKER_01: At the same time, I feel like SPEAKER_01: the easy solution to that is just be a host. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, 100%. SPEAKER_01: Be a host. SPEAKER_01: No, exactly what the things are SPEAKER_01: and just put someone else into play, SPEAKER_01: but I feel like it's easy to miss, obviously, SPEAKER_01: apps when you're making videos. SPEAKER_00: I think next week's video, SPEAKER_00: the big shoot you were talking about, SPEAKER_00: I think that's my favorite big shoot we've done SPEAKER_00: in terms of video. SPEAKER_01: Interesting. SPEAKER_00: Like, I think the missed beast one was a lot of fun, but... SPEAKER_01: It wasn't Psy. SPEAKER_01: It was spectacle, but not Psy. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, SPEAKER_00: yeah. SPEAKER_00: I left it thinking SPEAKER_00: there wasn't much personality of us in there SPEAKER_00: and whereas this one I left SPEAKER_00: and I was like, yeah, this one was good. SPEAKER_00: Like really, really good. SPEAKER_00: It's very us. SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think it's like the perfect combination of like SPEAKER_00: us and production. SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I agree. SPEAKER_00: So, yeah, this week's video, banger. SPEAKER_02: Sick. SPEAKER_00: There we go. SPEAKER_00: Or should be a nine out of 10. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, honestly, that's the way the game goes. SPEAKER_01: It's literally the way, SPEAKER_02: exactly the way it goes. SPEAKER_02: But yeah, I think... SPEAKER_02: Oh, what's this? SPEAKER_02: Oh, culture. SPEAKER_02: 92 SPEAKER_00: million. SPEAKER_00: That's our most viewed video. SPEAKER_00: That's crazy. Unknown: I SPEAKER_00: think that as well, that one is... SPEAKER_00: That's the perfect video SPEAKER_00: in terms of... SPEAKER_00: We were on the bad team, but SPEAKER_00: it was so fun. SPEAKER_00: And the good team obviously just had like an amazing time. Unknown: Because SPEAKER_00: I know the first one where you were in London, SPEAKER_00: as much as you meant to do the bad team... SPEAKER_00: It actually really happened. SPEAKER_00: You didn't actually do anything. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: And I don't think you had that much fun SPEAKER_00: that you were Unknown: like... Unknown: And SPEAKER_01: the secret ingredient is alcohol. SPEAKER_01: Every Sidemen video is better. SPEAKER_01: It's true. SPEAKER_01: There's alcohol involved. SPEAKER_01: Which is the SPEAKER_02: one... SPEAKER_02: Neither of you were there, the cube. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, exactly. SPEAKER_01: That was so SPEAKER_02: bad. SPEAKER_02: And then we just got pissed and it was so good. SPEAKER_01: You know, I organised that whole video. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: And because JJ didn't like the shoot, SPEAKER_01: he had me take a yellow card SPEAKER_01: and only get half the video. SPEAKER_01: I enjoyed that video. SPEAKER_02: I can't say anything else in there. SPEAKER_02: I think it was because they were like... SPEAKER_02: Ask Vic about the thumbnail. SPEAKER_02: He hasn't replied. Unknown: I had go for SPEAKER_02: it. Unknown: That SPEAKER_01: was an incredible video. SPEAKER_01: Too fair it didn't do very well though. SPEAKER_01: No. SPEAKER_01: Too fair. SPEAKER_01: I remember watching SPEAKER_00: this video and thinking, SPEAKER_00: no one wants to be. SPEAKER_01: I laughed. SPEAKER_01: I laughed more than like other videos. SPEAKER_01: They were fine people. SPEAKER_01: They even tried. SPEAKER_01: Stephen tried. SPEAKER_01: It's the secret sauce also. Unknown: Well, SPEAKER_00: now we know as well SPEAKER_00: that we actually can miss SPEAKER_00: like multiple people. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: We've done shoots now SPEAKER_00: where three of us are missing. Unknown: True, SPEAKER_01: true, true. SPEAKER_00: So I think as much as it does SPEAKER_00: kind of take away from the Sidemen, SPEAKER_00: it's more of like, okay, SPEAKER_00: there's proof that there's longevity. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: Because before we were like, SPEAKER_00: okay, if one Sidemen's gone. SPEAKER_00: It's done. SPEAKER_00: The house of cards collapses. SPEAKER_00: And obviously JJ was missing SPEAKER_00: and Ethan was missing. SPEAKER_00: You've been missing. SPEAKER_00: We all had COVID. SPEAKER_00: Missed some. SPEAKER_00: So yeah. SPEAKER_00: We can prove that we can survive. SPEAKER_02: We'll survive. SPEAKER_00: Nice. SPEAKER_00: Was this you trying to step over it? SPEAKER_00: Bro, you were so bad. SPEAKER_01: Well, I was drunk and blind. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: Look how replayed that. SPEAKER_01: By the way. Unknown: I SPEAKER_02: was really disappointed. SPEAKER_02: It's the last one when SPEAKER_01: you jump, isn't it? SPEAKER_02: They take them off. SPEAKER_02: Okay. SPEAKER_02: That's that one. SPEAKER_01: No, no, no. SPEAKER_01: It's the clip where they put it. SPEAKER_01: They put it up. SPEAKER_01: This clip here. SPEAKER_01: This actually finished me. SPEAKER_01: What is this? Unknown: Did SPEAKER_02: you know? SPEAKER_02: No. SPEAKER_02: I felt like you could have heard them. SPEAKER_02: Bro, I had no idea. SPEAKER_02: I'm absolutely pissed. SPEAKER_00: It's the fact, right? SPEAKER_00: You've got nothing. SPEAKER_00: And you somehow walked into the wall. SPEAKER_02: That's where you can't write it SPEAKER_02: and it just won't. SPEAKER_02: Yeah. SPEAKER_02: After that first step as well, SPEAKER_02: in my head I was really happy. SPEAKER_02: I was like, wow, I've just smashed that. SPEAKER_02: Right, you've got the phone. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, SPEAKER_00: yeah. SPEAKER_00: That was so good. SPEAKER_02: It was like a shambles of a shoot SPEAKER_02: because everyone was just giddy. SPEAKER_02: You know what I'm saying? SPEAKER_02: That's good though, that's good. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it helped. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, there's four of the boys, SPEAKER_02: me and then Stephen. SPEAKER_02: I also said on the podcast SPEAKER_02: when we filmed that one, SPEAKER_02: I was really angry, right? SPEAKER_02: Because whoever the camera people were, SPEAKER_02: I know who they were, SPEAKER_02: but I won't say. SPEAKER_02: They had like wide angle lenses, right? SPEAKER_02: Bare wide. SPEAKER_02: And they would smush SPEAKER_02: together all the time. SPEAKER_02: So there's not many of us, right? SPEAKER_02: And we're always like, SPEAKER_02: me and Jason Toby, SPEAKER_02: we're like, SPEAKER_02: we're like, SPEAKER_02: literally like sideways on SPEAKER_02: and like together. SPEAKER_02: And then all guys, SPEAKER_02: can you squish in? SPEAKER_02: And I'm like, how about you walk back? SPEAKER_02: Like, please, SPEAKER_02: like walk back, Unknown: man. SPEAKER_02: You'll fill us in. SPEAKER_02: Cause we just pull it off SPEAKER_02: and just go to any shop SPEAKER_02: where we're all like, SPEAKER_02: that's not bad. SPEAKER_02: And we find us all together SPEAKER_02: in stages. SPEAKER_02: Where they're against SPEAKER_00: the wall. SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think it's earlier SPEAKER_02: on. SPEAKER_02: It's earlier on. SPEAKER_02: One of the first ones. SPEAKER_02: Randy's onto it. Unknown: Look at SPEAKER_01: Jason standing. SPEAKER_01: Ethan. SPEAKER_01: That is very uncomfortable. SPEAKER_02: And there's more examples, SPEAKER_02: but go a bit earlier on perhaps. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that one, that one, that one. SPEAKER_02: John's coming. SPEAKER_01: Not John. SPEAKER_02: Randy's coming for your job. SPEAKER_02: Yeah. SPEAKER_02: Get Randy on the lens. SPEAKER_02: It's always funny, man. SPEAKER_02: It's SPEAKER_00: so squished. SPEAKER_02: I'm being overdramatic, of course, SPEAKER_02: but like, SPEAKER_02: they could have walked back. SPEAKER_02: It's cute SPEAKER_01: though, it's intimate. SPEAKER_01: It was nice. SPEAKER_01: It was nice. SPEAKER_01: But SPEAKER_02: I'm thinking, SPEAKER_02: say you didn't have COVID, SPEAKER_02: all the boys didn't have COVID. SPEAKER_02: Is the video fucked now? SPEAKER_02: Cause there's more of you. SPEAKER_02: They can't fit in frame. SPEAKER_02: But yeah, anyway, SPEAKER_02: I'm conscious you guys SPEAKER_02: have got some filming. Unknown: We SPEAKER_00: have some more Sidemen filming. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: We're hoping SPEAKER_00: that we can continuously SPEAKER_00: post on that channel. SPEAKER_00: Yeah. SPEAKER_00: Maybe even have a surprise SPEAKER_00: coming up. SPEAKER_02: Nice. SPEAKER_02: You know what I'm talking about, right? SPEAKER_02: I do, I do indeed. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we're sourcing. SPEAKER_02: We're sourcing. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, SPEAKER_00: sourcing something up. SPEAKER_01: Literally, SPEAKER_01: unbranded itself as a Sidemen, SPEAKER_01: but shit. SPEAKER_01: Cause it's actually the Sidemen, SPEAKER_01: but good now. SPEAKER_02: When they say they're sourcing, SPEAKER_02: they're actually coming out SPEAKER_02: as like Sidemen branded a sauce, guys. SPEAKER_02: In all shops. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, full size. SPEAKER_02: They have seven of them. SPEAKER_02: You do have that. SPEAKER_02: You do have that. SPEAKER_02: What next? SPEAKER_00: But, SPEAKER_00: yeah, SPEAKER_00: thank you for coming on. SPEAKER_00: Yeah, thank you. SPEAKER_00: It's been sick. SPEAKER_00: And SPEAKER_00: I mean, SPEAKER_00: everyone knows who Vic is.
