Unknown: And vikstar: then caught up with a load of the gang. vikstar: My international squad fan Unknown: came vikstar: through. vikstar: And then we, a load of us carried on across to Australia. vikstar: As you can see, we went to Brisbane, vikstar: hang out with Lachie, meet some kangaroos. vikstar: They're legendary. vikstar: They're so cute. vikstar: Like you would Unknown: think vikstar: something that big wouldn't be just, vikstar: look how friendly and sure they are. vikstar: Yeah, someone jacked them, aren't they? vikstar: You would expect them to be like rabid, but no. simon: If you panned the camera there and it just punched Rob in the head, simon: it would have been so funny. vikstar: There was actually one kangaroo, vikstar: there was a lady feeding the kangaroos and she ran out of feed, vikstar: so she started walking away and it ran up to her and pushed her. vikstar: They're quite cheeky. randolph: They love their feed. randolph: Isn't there a video of one of them that is in, randolph: someone's in an AVV or their house or something, randolph: and one's knocking on the window with his nails? randolph: That's terrifying. randolph: Go on YouTube and type in kangaroo knocking on the window. randolph: It's mad. randolph: This is the simon: proper life. simon: Bro, honestly, we won't randolph: get the sound on here, randolph: but literally his claws are fucking massive. randolph: It's actually ridiculous. vikstar: Do they use their claws though?

Unknown: And vikstar: it was like that. vikstar: And then with Warzone, vikstar: it was like, vikstar: oh, vikstar: I'm going to learn these guns are good. vikstar: Oh, vikstar: if you slide cancel, vikstar: you can get around faster. vikstar: If Unknown: you vikstar: lean on these walls, vikstar: you can do better. vikstar: If you do this kind of stuff, vikstar: if you spam UAVs, vikstar: you're going to be able to get loads of kills. vikstar: But when everyone knows it, vikstar: it's not fun. vikstar: And when everyone practices it, vikstar: everyone gets so good. vikstar: It's like, vikstar: it's not as exciting. vikstar: So I feel like Warzone 2 vikstar: is going to be mechanically very similar. randolph: Yeah. randolph: And also, randolph: I feel like Warzone was like randolph: a time and a place. randolph: Because of lockdown randolph: and COVID, randolph: everyone was kind of like randolph: nonstop playing it. randolph: So it's more like the moment randolph: in time that we all miss, randolph: not necessarily the game. randolph: The game still existed now randolph: in Verdant. randolph: So I don't think it still randolph: would be what it was. randolph: So it was Among Us. randolph: Yeah. simon: Like Among Us was the, Unknown: it simon: was the lockdown game. simon: Yeah. simon: Everyone enjoyed it simon: for a little bit now. simon: I mean, simon: we could literally play it. simon: We still enjoy it simon: for the most part. simon: I'm so glad vikstar: we're able vikstar: to keep it alive vikstar: because it is such a content platform. randolph: It is because the lobbies randolph: are so bad though. randolph: Like our lobby is awful randolph: when we play. randolph: That's why it's good. randolph: Yeah, the vikstar: good lobbies vikstar: were always boring. vikstar: Yeah. vikstar: Like randolph: when people got good randolph: at the game, randolph: it just got really boring. randolph: Oh, I've just, randolph: I've checked you didn't like randolph: upload for like 2.3 seconds randolph: instead of two. randolph: I'm like, bro. simon: Please. simon: I just used to lie simon: about that stuff. simon: I used to go like, simon: oh, you only did that simon: for a second. simon: But it actually takes simon: like 1.5 seconds. simon: And they go, simon: oh, you're a little nerd. simon: I was like, simon: I was lying. simon: If randolph: you say something randolph: with enough confidence. randolph: I love you always get like, randolph: if you're level, randolph: if you're high level as well, randolph: you get fucked. randolph: Well, because of the mod simon: ones we do now, simon: Ethan got modded to simon: like level 60 something. simon: And I'm only level 18. simon: Yeah. simon: So now I can't be simon: voted out just for level. randolph: But I remember how long randolph: that last one was took randolph: to get going. randolph: Oh, no, that's not randolph: the mod. randolph: Yeah. randolph: Because I was not randolph: in that episode, randolph: but I was in two randolph: of the recordings Unknown: because randolph: we never actually vikstar: got it done. vikstar: I'll tell you what, vikstar: trying to install vikstar: gaming mods with people vikstar: that don't know vikstar: how to use computers, vikstar: people that don't know vikstar: how to actually know. vikstar: I'm not going to. vikstar: I was about to say people vikstar: who can't install windows. vikstar: J.J. was actually all right. vikstar: J.J. was one of the vikstar: better ones. vikstar: Oh, no, no. vikstar: We'll call him out. vikstar: Theo Baker. simon: Theo Baker doesn't know simon: how to use. simon: He was like, simon: OK, so now do I need simon: to turn my PC on?

Okay. vikstar: It used to crash my computer. vikstar: Oh, it did. vikstar: I remember this shit. vikstar: It did. vikstar: I would keep rejoining the lobby vikstar: like every second game and a half. vikstar: And I'd be trying to stream vikstar: so my whole stream would end. vikstar: I remember this. vikstar: That was dramatic. vikstar: I'm traumatized by that mod. simon: That mod is so, simon: it's so good though. simon: Yeah. simon: The moment where you find JJ. simon: Yeah, yeah. simon: And JJ's like not like... randolph: Oh, shit. randolph: Oh, shit. simon: Bro. simon: That moment is goated. randolph: I feel like the moment is nice randolph: because Unknown: like, randolph: you know, randolph: JJ really enjoys it as well. randolph: You can tell when he's in it. randolph: That's always nice to see. randolph: It's a good game, man. randolph: It's a very good like concept. randolph: But it's just, yeah, randolph: people took it too serious. randolph: I remember we used to play with Tali randolph: and then it got to a point randolph: where she hated our lobby. simon: Oh, yeah. simon: No, she won't play with us. simon: She likes to play like, simon: she's like, simon: why would you troll? randolph: She's simon: like, simon: why would you not want to try and win? randolph: That's enough for me. randolph: We just vote someone out. randolph: Some of them are just talking randolph: and get voted out. randolph: For no reason. randolph: JJ says something. randolph: Oh, man. randolph: Why are you washed? randolph: The simon: most recent video is actually, simon: oh, Vic talks a lot simon: when he's in post. simon: Yeah. simon: Vote him out. simon: And he's out. simon: Was it you as well? simon: No. simon: That was the worst part. vikstar: I feel like I talk a lot vikstar: all of the time. simon: Well, there was only three, simon: it was only like you simon: and two people left. vikstar: It was me, vikstar: Toby, Viz and Jamie. simon: Four. simon: Yeah, so four. simon: And it was, simon: I think it was Jamie. vikstar: And Toby was like, vikstar: Vic, what happened? vikstar: I explained exactly what happened. vikstar: Oh, you're talking a lot. vikstar: I got voted out. vikstar: I was like, why? randolph: I remember Toby played me randolph: with a symphony card once. randolph: He's like, randolph: you always say it's me, simon: man. randolph: You always say it's me. randolph: He did that vikstar: recently. randolph: He did that recently. randolph: And it was Unknown: him.

Unknown: Just. randolph: Because sometimes for me, like going to the gym is always like the long part. randolph: Like actually getting out and going. randolph: And vikstar: it's finding the gap in the day. vikstar: So sometimes you'll think, right, I've got 50 minutes. vikstar: It's going to take me 10 minutes to get to the gym, then 10 minutes to get back. vikstar: So then I'll have 30 minutes to gym. vikstar: What's the point? vikstar: Whereas like. randolph: Yeah. randolph: I'll fit it vikstar: in. vikstar: I can kind of be like working on stuff. vikstar: Like if I know I've got a delivery coming or something, I'll be like, right, I'm vikstar: going to go and start my workout. vikstar: I'll stop for five minutes in the middle, go back to it. vikstar: That's randolph: sick. randolph: My dad's currently putting my gym floor in, in my Unknown: garage. randolph: Damn. simon: Yeah, randolph: yeah. randolph: Very nice. randolph: Also, gym equipment is way more expensive than I thought it was. vikstar: Oh yeah. vikstar: It went up during lockdown. vikstar: I feel like it's been up. vikstar: During lockdown, so many people wanted home gym equipment. vikstar: The prices went up. randolph: Yeah. vikstar: And they just left the prices. vikstar: They just went, all right, you're not exactly all right. vikstar: We're kind of rich now. vikstar: Yeah, true, true. vikstar: We'll leave the prices randolph: up. randolph: Look, even the, is that the AC? vikstar: Yeah. randolph: Even the AC is colour coordinated. vikstar: It was white. vikstar: They wrapped it. vikstar: That's rad. vikstar: That's so sick, man. vikstar: Yeah, but the treadmill was like three grand. vikstar: I'm like, fuck Unknown: man. vikstar: I still got the one Simon bought me. vikstar: Class, class, class. vikstar: That was a simon: Simon video. simon: Yeah. simon: Nice, vikstar: nice. vikstar: And I still haven't activated the Peloton membership. vikstar: I don't want it. vikstar: I just want to run. vikstar: True. randolph: I was thinking that. randolph: I was looking at the difference between Peloton and a regular one. randolph: Am I just paying for the bloke to tell me what to do? vikstar: I personally, I just don't, I just want, but it has a setting where you just press vikstar: just run. simon: Yeah. vikstar: And you can set the incline and speed and that's all I want to do. vikstar: I stick an iPad. vikstar: It has this massive screen and I just have an iPad stuck on the massive screen with vikstar: whatever I'm watching on randolph: it. randolph: But I'm vikstar: like, it's crazy. vikstar: It's like an, it's one of the most expensive treadmills and then you pay them like vikstar: 40 quid a month or something on top. vikstar: I swear it's a scam. vikstar: But the thing is other people are like, yeah, I love how I do the classes. vikstar: I take the classes offline. vikstar: That's the thing I know Con does simon: I think. simon: Yeah. simon: Con said that he uses like the other stuff. simon: Like he'll just put it onto the TV, like a different TV and do the classes. simon: I just love it. simon: You can literally do like a yoga class on a different TV. simon: You can sign in on any other room. simon: So I think it is worth it if you, vikstar: if that is how you work out. vikstar: But for me, I'm Unknown: just, simon: if you want to just run, there's no point. Unknown: Well, simon: speaking of Simon videos, yes. simon: The video that went Unknown: out, simon: this is next week. vikstar: Okay. Unknown: So simon: young versus old just went out. vikstar: Yeah. vikstar: Young guns. simon: Me and Vic were on the young team. Unknown: You simon: haven't seen it because it's not out yet. vikstar: I've seen some Unknown: clips. simon: Yeah. randolph: Yeah. simon: Of the old Unknown: team. randolph: Yeah. simon: Okay. simon: We were on the young team randolph: and Unknown: it simon: started off a bit stinky. simon: Yeah. simon: We went to KidZone. simon: Right. vikstar: Right. simon: I'd been there before for- simon: When you were a kid. simon: And also another video. vikstar: That same exact place or just edited? vikstar: It was a different one. vikstar: Okay. simon: Yeah. simon: But then we went to Whitewater rafting. vikstar: Oh. vikstar: And it simon: was me, him, Toby and JJ. simon: Yeah. vikstar: Actually, you know what? vikstar: They shouldn't have done it. vikstar: Yeah. vikstar: I'm very mixed. vikstar: I was just about to say they should have done it, but then I actually realized how mad vikstar: those rapids were. simon: Yeah. simon: Whose they? simon: JJ and Toby didn't do it. simon: Right. simon: Okay. simon: So me and Vic went in. simon: It was me and Vic. simon: In front of us, two instructors who, you know, literally do it every day. simon: Instructor. simon: Behind us, the main instructor who kind of controls it vikstar: all. simon: It was meant to Unknown: be simon: him, me, Vic, JJ, Toby. vikstar: That would have been Unknown: so vikstar: funny. simon: It literally, it didn't end well. simon: We went down it once, went around the whole thing. simon: You have to start off, you have to jump into the water. vikstar: Okay. simon: And then kind of just float down. simon: Just to see how, vikstar: yeah. vikstar: Feel what it feels like to be in the water. vikstar: Yeah. simon: And then we went down at the second time and we kind of turn around on the rapids Unknown: and simon: try and Unknown: like. vikstar: Balance, basically. vikstar: Yeah. vikstar: Balance in the swell. simon: Yeah. simon: I didn't really get it. vikstar: So that, I think what that is, is Unknown: like, vikstar: I think, I'm no expert, but I think in vikstar: Whitewater rafting, it's important to be able to Unknown: like vikstar: control where you are and vikstar: you need to be able to kind of hold your position on the rapids. randolph: Okay. randolph: I vikstar: don't know, maybe, I don't know why. vikstar: Maybe, I don't know, there's like a log. vikstar: I don't know, that's fallen in front of you. vikstar: I actually, I'm completely good at this stuff. vikstar: Sounds good. vikstar: It sounds really good. vikstar: It seems like there is a reason to be able to try and hold yourself in a vikstar: stack of points. vikstar: They were trying to teach us to do that. simon: So it was, yeah. simon: So we turn around and then we go into the rapids and the guy is like, randolph: lean left. simon: And me and Vic have to lean left. simon: Really? simon: Right. simon: Keep doing that. Unknown: And simon: eventually Unknown: we simon: started tipping a lot. randolph: Yeah. simon: And then they basically, the whole thing just flipped. vikstar: Yeah. simon: And we ended up, I ended up under the raft. simon: I didn't see what happened to you. simon: I didn't vikstar: hit myself in the chin with my oar. simon: He told you to hold on. vikstar: But when you're Unknown: flipping. simon: Yeah, man. simon: And then, yeah, we just went, got sent down and. simon: But it was fun randolph: though. simon: I actually really enjoyed it to be fair. simon: I did vikstar: really enjoy it. vikstar: Because the fact you went randolph: in on your own first to feel it out, like randolph: when you fall in, it's like same as that, right? randolph: Yeah, it was. randolph: Without the canoe on your head. randolph: Or whatever you're on. randolph: Yeah, it was a vikstar: inflatable raft. vikstar: But Unknown: doing vikstar: that in an actual like plastic canoe, I think I would die. vikstar: I would just get stuck upside down. vikstar: After the round. simon: I actually randolph: haven't done simon: that. simon: Really? simon: White water in the canoe? simon: In the canoe, yeah. simon: In a solo canoe? randolph: We had two of Unknown: us. randolph: Wow. randolph: It was PGL. randolph: I was Unknown: in like randolph: year six. Unknown: Were simon: they quite Unknown: big simon: rapids? randolph: Yeah, they're of decent size. randolph: They're sick. randolph: This doesn't vikstar: sound safe. Unknown: But randolph: then vikstar: again, when we were kids, health and safety didn't really matter. vikstar: True, true. randolph: PGL, which I'm pretty sure is stuff like parents get lost, right? vikstar: I don't know what PGL is. vikstar: Oh, I'm sure it's like randolph: a school trip we went on. vikstar: I was fucking sick though. randolph: So good, man. randolph: Is it a time in age where like, you know when you do something randolph: pairs at school and you're like picking partners? randolph: And then we had this friend and I was like, I'm with you, right? randolph: Dynamic duo? randolph: Yeah, yeah. randolph: And then someone else asked him, can I be on your team? randolph: No, I'm with Andrew. vikstar: I'm with Big Randy. vikstar: You're gonna get fucked made of shit. randolph: Go with the loser kid, man. vikstar: Like squid game where they just die. randolph: So Toby and JJ just didn't want to do Unknown: it? simon: Yeah. randolph: I mean, it is very scary. randolph: It looks very frightening. simon: It's not randolph: just swimming, you know. randolph: Well, simon: when we jumped in and then when we went down the first time simon: and it was very calm, I was thinking, you lot are like, simon: you should have done vikstar: this. vikstar: I think it was very calm though because we had three professional vikstar: whitewater racquet members with us. vikstar: I simon: think the guy behind us could have done it on his own. simon: But Donny was vikstar: like, all's simon: up and then he's just doing it. vikstar: And I simon: think Unknown: we simon: would have struggled a bit. vikstar: Yeah, true. vikstar: He would have always kept it. simon: But I think the last one, 100%, they would have had a simon: terrible time. vikstar: They would have actually thought they were going to die. vikstar: Good content. simon: Like, yeah. simon: JJ would have had good content there. randolph: But you also got your face painted? simon: I did, yeah. randolph: Also, he turned up. randolph: Bro, I went to a podcast last week with Nathan Dore. randolph: My guy turns up with eyeliner on. randolph: Do you look like young men? simon: That was good. simon: Ever since that. simon: So as soon as I had the eyeliner on, it was afterwards. simon: I've washed it all off and I can't get rid of this bit. simon: And then we had the Sidemen party and I still couldn't simon: get rid of it. simon: So I turned up and I've got this vikstar: bit. vikstar: With the smokey eye. vikstar: But suddenly he simon: just went, oh, I just thought simon: you were tired. simon: Bro, Charlie Roxford must be like, my guy. simon: Not here. simon: It wasn't like a bag. simon: It was a line. randolph: Yeah. simon: It wasn't a bag. simon: It was a line. simon: Shit, bro. simon: Take that one out. simon: Sidemen party vikstar: was crazy. randolph: Sidemen party simon: actually was crazy. simon: It was. simon: It was all right. simon: I thought it was all right. simon: Yeah. simon: I compare it to last year and I really like simon: last year's one. vikstar: We were pretty hands on last year. simon: I vikstar: remember, Unknown: like, vikstar: I went even to check out vikstar: the venue before. vikstar: Take some keyboards out of the trees. vikstar: Oh, that was so bad. vikstar: They were like, gamer party, let's hang vikstar: keyboards and mice out of the tree. vikstar: I was like, take all of that out now. vikstar: It's awful. vikstar: I'm insulted. simon: I think it's because this year we had simon: our charity match so recently. vikstar: Yeah. vikstar: That Unknown: we simon: saw that as our party. simon: Yeah, I didn't really want vikstar: to do one. vikstar: Yeah, this was more of simon: like a simon: it's all being done. vikstar: I think eight was also cool vikstar: because we were launching sides vikstar: and XIX. vikstar: Yeah. vikstar: Whereas this year, vikstar: the charity match was our vikstar: big thing of the year. vikstar: The Sidemen turning nine, vikstar: it's like, hey, great, we're old. simon: Well, next year, 10 years. simon: That should be. simon: And that has to be. simon: That has to be good.

haven't played like randolph: 10 minutes turned Unknown: off randolph: it's stressing me out man randolph: everyone in the chat randolph: was like randolph: you don't even do anything randolph: 10 minutes you didn't simon: do any damage randolph: yeah I killed one guy randolph: finally Unknown: but randolph: you think Unknown: I randolph: think yeah randolph: it's not up to cross simon: the map simon: with Winston randolph: but the gaming world is dry though randolph: I feel like randolph: there's no games man randolph: I feel bad for some streamers randolph: what are they doing? vikstar: or even gaming YouTubers vikstar: gaming streamers randolph: although simon: COD simon: COD simon: by the time this comes out simon: COD is out randolph: multiplayer simon: you gonna get on Unknown: it? vikstar: probably not multiplayer vikstar: I think I will actually vikstar: probably need to though vikstar: to get stuff for Warzone vikstar: yeah randolph: that was the smartest thing randolph: they did for actual randolph: the 2019 Warzone randolph: so many people bought randolph: they did yeah randolph: you buy vikstar: every COD vikstar: to get guns vikstar: otherwise what randolph: was it randolph: plummet? vikstar: plunder vikstar: and that was sick though vikstar: when you could do vikstar: helicopter concept vikstar: you'd do the supply runs vikstar: and you'd max a gun vikstar: in like two hours vikstar: and then they'd patch that vikstar: and I was like vikstar: now what simon: now I'm sad simon: I feel like simon: I'm the only person simon: that I've met simon: that really has enjoyed simon: COD multiplayer simon: for the last three years simon: because you vikstar: didn't play vikstar: the originals vikstar: true vikstar: yeah you didn't rinse vikstar: the originals vikstar: I put like vikstar: probably 70 days vikstar: into like vikstar: COD 4 World at War vikstar: Modern Warfare 2 vikstar: Black Ops 1 vikstar: Black Ops Unknown: 2 vikstar: Black simon: Ops 1 I did Unknown: but simon: I think that was it simon: Modern Warfare 2 simon: was the one that simon: I got into simon: we should bring back vikstar: more Sidemen vikstar: COD wager matches vikstar: I hope they have them vikstar: in Modern Warfare 2 vikstar: I don't think they will vikstar: because it was more vikstar: wager simon: matches were the vikstar: they were in vikstar: Black Unknown: Ops simon: this is the one where simon: you like sticks vikstar: and stones vikstar: oh simon: yeah simon: that was JJ's simon: chicken dinner simon: and I used to simon: get vikstar: to the last vikstar: gun on gun game vikstar: and just knife everyone vikstar: set them back Unknown: yeah simon: that's like simon: that's one of my simon: favourite videos from JJ simon: he's playing on simon: one of the like simon: base maps Unknown: and it's simon: one in the chamber Unknown: and simon: he's Unknown: like simon: oh simon: one man simon: one gun simon: one bullet simon: six men simon: he's randolph: like simon: and I remembered simon: my chicken was ready simon: it's like simon: it's just top step simon: and then he just runs down simon: and he goes simon: bang bang bang simon: and he goes simon: then he ran at me simon: like an angry baboon simon: and I Unknown: said Unknown: sit simon: down bitch randolph: he's generally so funny simon: I randolph: remember randolph: I might have thought randolph: it was on the last podcast randolph: but I don't know randolph: I'll just tell it again randolph: but I was with randolph: I did a randolph: game against Castro randolph: on FIFA randolph: and we were talking about JJ Unknown: and randolph: he was like randolph: oh you're good at FIFA though right randolph: I was like randolph: no randolph: they put me and Castro randolph: on like 1v1 randolph: and the loser gets slimed randolph: so obviously I got slimed randolph: because the guy plays it randolph: like a living simon: and randolph: then he was like randolph: oh no but you're sick at FIFA randolph: you beat JJ right Unknown: and randolph: I was like randolph: yeah randolph: JJ is shit at FIFA randolph: really like randolph: not good at all randolph: he was like randolph: he was a FIFA YouTuber randolph: I'm like Unknown: yeah randolph: it wasn't about being good at FIFA randolph: it was about being entertaining randolph: well back simon: then as well simon: it was easy to be simon: good at FIFA simon: it was very like randolph: most FIFA's now randolph: you just views the randolph: what's good simon: and he would have done that simon: yeah simon: I randolph: mean back in the day randolph: he's better than me randolph: but I Unknown: mean randolph: he still would beat me now randolph: I'm not great randolph: but it's not hard randolph: although simon: he stopped Unknown: playing randolph: has he? randolph: now I watch simon: he was bagging the game out simon: and he was like simon: yeah I'm in Div 6 simon: this is my new team simon: you know simon: he'd link cards in the chat simon: and stuff like that simon: and everyone was like simon: what the fuck is going on simon: is the new FIFA vikstar: out? vikstar: yeah simon: yeah it came out simon: end of September vikstar: yikes simon: and vikstar: they simon: recorded clubs the other day vikstar: yeah simon: me and you simon: oh vikstar: you weren't there vikstar: no simon: no simon: yeah it was vikstar: Harry said he didn't enjoy it vikstar: apparently vikstar: Harry simon: doesn't like clubs vikstar: oh? simon: because whenever we've recorded simon: it's Unknown: like simon: you don't enjoy clubs simon: much simon: like simon: it's fun simon: but it's not simon: it's not your thing simon: actually vikstar: I don't enjoy vikstar: as much as it just doesn't vikstar: it's vikstar: I think the videos are good vikstar: but they just don't do Unknown: well simon: yeah simon: that's vikstar: what vikstar: that's what vikstar: because it takes vikstar: probably more time vikstar: to record that than something vikstar: oh simon: 100% vikstar: and then when it doesn't do as well vikstar: I'm like simon: it's because it was simon: I feel like it was simon: like an iconic simon: more Sidemen series vikstar: yeah simon: I mean it was vikstar: an iconic vikstar: Sidemen channel series vikstar: it was the first vikstar: series we started vikstar: on the Sidemen channel Unknown: and simon: then it just simon: yeah it fell off Unknown: like simon: Among Us is now simon: like Unknown: a simon: classic simon: Sidemen series simon: but yeah simon: then Harry apparently simon: doesn't enjoy clubs Unknown: I simon: heard it through the grapevine simon: wow simon: I was randolph: confused randolph: there you Unknown: go randolph: yeah randolph: Sidemen fans are crying Unknown: how could he simon: well yeah simon: I don't think clubs is coming back simon: anytime soon now simon: I'm vikstar: not complaining vikstar: I feel like vikstar: I feel like there's so much vikstar: we can do with that channel simon: oh 100 Unknown: % vikstar: I simon: think simon: it's actually Unknown: it simon: hurts me knowing that simon: obviously you posted simon: so many videos Unknown: over simon: the year simon: like over so many years simon: so have I simon: so has Josh vikstar: yeah vikstar: so has Ethan Unknown: and simon: we can't simon: get more Sidemen simon: posting simon: like simon: we struggle with simon: 2 or 3 a week simon: yeah vikstar: we would do recordings vikstar: but it was our whole life simon: it was simon: we vikstar: would wake up vikstar: to record Unknown: for vikstar: 4 hours vikstar: to edit the videos vikstar: to post them vikstar: to do it again vikstar: the next day vikstar: but simon: even still simon: we would record simon: for 4 hours simon: now simon: we record Unknown: for simon: like 2 hours simon: and people's attention spans simon: are gone vikstar: it was so much easier vikstar: back then as well vikstar: because we just had vikstar: to record the content Unknown: and vikstar: make the content good vikstar: and Unknown: I vikstar: was posting vikstar: GTA vikstar: episode 432 simon: now you need the title simon: now you need vikstar: the title vikstar: and the thumbnail vikstar: or no one's gonna click it vikstar: so it was a different time vikstar: we were able to do Unknown: that Unknown: we vikstar: could record vikstar: so much volume vikstar: but it doesn't vikstar: it's not about recording vikstar: volume on YouTube vikstar: at the moment Unknown: yeah simon: but still simon: I think Unknown: we simon: like simon: some of us simon: have gone through the phase Unknown: of simon: just grinding simon: for 12 hours a day simon: we could sit there Unknown: and Unknown: if simon: we had the ideas there Unknown: would simon: you happily simon: like would you happily simon: sit there simon: you go one day simon: I'd spend 6 vikstar: hours vikstar: recording gaming vikstar: for more time vikstar: as long as everything works randolph: as long as randolph: I'm sat waiting randolph: and if you're enjoying randolph: the games as well randolph: it goes by really quick randolph: because if you're not randolph: enjoying the game randolph: it's like it just drags simon: and also if yeah simon: if something doesn't work simon: like the Among Us mod simon: the second that happened simon: and we spent 2 hours vikstar: sick thumbnails vikstar: back then when simon: thumbnails simon: didn't matter simon: short and sweet vikstar: clips vikstar: short and sweet clips vikstar: bro simon: do you think simon: right simon: if simon: say you were doing simon: these videos simon: 11 years ago vikstar: yes simon: and you had today's simon: thumbnails Unknown: do simon: you think people Unknown: would simon: like simon: they would do way Unknown: better vikstar: I'm sorry vikstar: I don't know what's vikstar: happening Unknown: sorry simon: raining care packages simon: I think vikstar: we crashed vikstar: yeah vikstar: I think we crashed them vikstar: oh my god vikstar: I love this fucking game though vikstar: I think we crashed the game vikstar: do you think the graphics vikstar: I don't know why vikstar: oh my simon: god vikstar: oh yeah vikstar: oh simon: my randolph: god randolph: yo that's sick Unknown: that is sick randolph: bro randolph: you know what randolph: you know randolph: look at this description randolph: look at the description randolph: we like that and everything Unknown: and randolph: also randolph: you would have been creasing randolph: however old you were randolph: no I know simon: I can picture simon: your fucking voices simon: or your little simon: squeaky voices simon: oh my Unknown: god vikstar: see I miss simon: content like that simon: yeah yeah yeah simon: like the little simon: short videos like that simon: imagine vikstar: you drop vikstar: that on your channel vikstar: today vikstar: 30 seconds of care package vikstar: is falling vikstar: what the fuck is this vikstar: but I guess Unknown: that's simon: that vikstar: could be a short vikstar: it could be a TikTok vikstar: it could be a TikTok randolph: yeah randolph: maybe content is going backwards Unknown: just randolph: better editors randolph: yeah Unknown: well simon: back then as well simon: if you posted Unknown: that simon: was before I even started simon: but simon: I remember you guys always saying simon: if you posted a video Unknown: like simon: two a day back Unknown: then simon: everyone called you like a money whore randolph: yeah randolph: yeah Unknown: whereas simon: now if you don't post Unknown: every simon: five days simon: everyone's like simon: well this guy's lazy vikstar: if someone else vikstar: edited your video vikstar: it was like vikstar: wow vikstar: you're such a randolph: you're vikstar: such a loser vikstar: yeah vikstar: you don't even care vikstar: you don't even care vikstar: about your channel vikstar: yeah vikstar: it makes no sense vikstar: I'm an editor vikstar: I'm paying someone vikstar: to make this better vikstar: wow vikstar: you're so out of touch Unknown: you vikstar: don't even care randolph: oh my randolph: YouTube Unknown: is randolph: it's gone through randolph: a really crazy cycle actually randolph: but it's randolph: obviously Unknown: we're glad vikstar: yeah randolph: it turned out alright vikstar: yeah simon: that first video going out simon: an editor's done simon: was like simon: terrifying simon: I vikstar: hope no one notices simon: yeah simon: oh my god simon: if someone points out simon: this thing simon: or this Unknown: thing randolph: jump cut fucking hell randolph: Simon that's not you randolph: I can tell randolph: yeah simon: it's just crazy simon: YouTube shorts as well simon: is gonna start Unknown: I vikstar: hear everyone vikstar: everyone's bigging up vikstar: the YouTube shorts vikstar: everyone is yeah vikstar: well simon: apparently they're gonna monetise Unknown: it simon: so vikstar: properly Unknown: yeah simon: well it is clear that Unknown: like randolph: TikTok has like randolph: shifted content randolph: a Unknown: lot Unknown: so randolph: they're probably looking at that randolph: and trying to compete Unknown: but randolph: it looks like randolph: they don't have to anymore Unknown: because randolph: aren't the US just gonna ban Unknown: it Unknown: well randolph: I didn't know about this randolph: is that randolph: is that a thing randolph: well JJ said it randolph: so I believe it randolph: JJ our political leader vikstar: our business economic leader vikstar: he does read a lot though vikstar: I simon: read nothing through the news simon: so I actually only simon: know what JJ puts in the chat simon: he vikstar: is a simon: sucker for headlines simon: he is vikstar: and I think I'm one source vikstar: I feel like he'll always have one source vikstar: and he'll just believe that vikstar: it's just a YouTube video vikstar: his timeline vikstar: his simon: recommended simon: video comes up simon: and he's just like simon: yo simon: do you know Liz Truss was an Unknown: alien randolph: yeah bro randolph: it's funny though randolph: he enjoys it simon: yeah randolph: but I think randolph: YouTube are randolph: from what I hear randolph: like really randolph: trying to push the shorts Unknown: but randolph: will that get you back vikstar: what's that simon: will that get you back Unknown: I vikstar: don't know vikstar: daily vikstar: daily vikstar: you could just do daily shorts vikstar: my favourite shorts were Harry's vikstar: Harry's vikstar: Harry's shorts simon: so vikstar: good vikstar: were incredible vikstar: please vikstar: please someone get this man vikstar: another deal for sure vikstar: what randolph: is it randolph: the egg Unknown: one randolph: remember the egg one randolph: yeah randolph: he's like randolph: he goes like Unknown: bro randolph: I never knew randolph: there was white eggs randolph: so randolph: he's like randolph: I didn't know randolph: he could do white eggs randolph: then he cracks it randolph: it just goes all over randolph: his cooker randolph: it's short randolph: obviously randolph: but it's really short vikstar: I'd like to believe vikstar: that this is stage vikstar: and he thinks vikstar: this is funny vikstar: but he has vikstar: I'm sure he's done this vikstar: this is simon: no Unknown: way vikstar: what a guy simon: they're normal eggs simon: they're just white simon: that's it randolph: no no no randolph: watch randolph: oh dear randolph: and people are wondering randolph: like damn randolph: like Harry's simon: what does he do simon: on a day to day simon: I bet it's like simon: coming up with business ventures simon: and video ideas simon: it's just that randolph: it's just funny randolph: how a lot of content like that randolph: and big moments just happen randolph: like obviously randolph: because I've been doing the side car randolph: I just see all the randolph: screenshots from the videos randolph: yeah randolph: I was thinking the same thing randolph: like him hitting his mum randolph: it's just randolph: it wasn't supposed to Unknown: happen randolph: you Unknown: know Unknown: I simon: think that's just the thing simon: with videos in general simon: stuff just goes right a lot vikstar: yeah simon: but you have to vikstar: do enough vikstar: and you have to create vikstar: the right parameters vikstar: for stuff to go right vikstar: and then sometimes vikstar: yeah you have videos vikstar: where like Unknown: an vikstar: example being vikstar: the Mr Beast video randolph: that vikstar: nothing remarkable vikstar: happened in that video vikstar: perhaps Nolan guessing vikstar: like four doors in a row vikstar: yeah vikstar: that was pretty like vikstar: wow vikstar: but beyond that vikstar: not a single remarkable thing vikstar: happened in that video vikstar: yeah vikstar: it could have randolph: but it vikstar: just didn't vikstar: and a lot of people would be Unknown: like vikstar: oh you know vikstar: Sidemen used to be so much funnier vikstar: when something else happened vikstar: but it's just like vikstar: sometimes stuff just doesn't vikstar: yeah vikstar: happen that way simon: if you rely on something simon: that is like a one take thing simon: yeah simon: you just have to hope simon: that it goes right simon: like the total wipeout we did simon: where Ethan almost broke his back simon: it's like simon: I know that went wrong simon: but it went right for content simon: yeah simon: now he's fine simon: it's like randolph: Dissolve Ball randolph: him getting hit with that as well randolph: even the randolph: the holding a war video randolph: I was just about to say that one randolph: JJ just like randolph: went crazy and it worked vikstar: yeah vikstar: yeah him doing water man vikstar: it wasn't planned vikstar: because he simon: wasn't meant simon: to even wear the thing simon: it was like a bandana here simon: and he was just going to simon: wear it normally simon: and then Toby put it simon: on his own face vikstar: yeah simon: and then we were like simon: oh it'd be funny for JJ simon: because his hair will simon: stick out the top vikstar: and now he's on a tops card vikstar: yeah vikstar: and that simon: character is like simon: one of the funniest ones simon: I actually really randolph: want that simon: card simon: by the way simon: I'm vikstar: checking eBay for that randolph: card vikstar: Scouring vikstar: yeah vikstar: they all randolph: got a water man randolph: yeah randolph: I'll buy it vikstar: from you vikstar: it looks fucking sick randolph: even because he's got randolph: like a pink background as well randolph: it just looks really good Unknown: yeah vikstar: yeah vikstar: there's so many things like that vikstar: also in that video vikstar: one of my favourite moments vikstar: of that whole video vikstar: is when JJ had to line his back vikstar: with his legs up in the air vikstar: and going through vikstar: that was the first one vikstar: yeah and the first one vikstar: and that was so easy to do vikstar: you just measure vikstar: where your legs need to be vikstar: you stick them up vikstar: the wall would have gone past him vikstar: no one would have laughed vikstar: it would have been like vikstar: oh nice good job vikstar: instead he gets his legs vikstar: too wide vikstar: he gets folded over backwards vikstar: falls face first vikstar: it was so slow as well vikstar: and it's hysterical vikstar: yeah vikstar: but that's content vikstar: you just have to vikstar: create the parameters vikstar: I want to watch it again vikstar: yeah vikstar: it's so slow vikstar: I actually watched the video vikstar: like three times Unknown: it's crazy vikstar: you get folded Unknown: in vikstar: I could watch that all day vikstar: and then there's Ethan randolph: right holding his nose Unknown: and randolph: then letting go randolph: and he actually goes randolph: in the water simon: yeah simon: the simon: when he does the bomb simon: onto the platform simon: so good simon: I think it might be that spike randolph: it's right at the end randolph: it's very close to the end randolph: what's that spike Unknown: though? vikstar: oh this was a disaster vikstar: oh this simon: is simon: yeah this is bad vikstar: it's just the wrong way vikstar: no Tobi jumps vikstar: I rate Tobi for trying simon: but he jumps Unknown: and simon: ruins it vikstar: oh see I see vikstar: yeah vikstar: he hits JJ's head Unknown: yeah simon: and that's where I got simon: I got messed up with my back Unknown: and simon: then yeah simon: go to the end simon: I think it Unknown: is simon: there'll be Unknown: a simon: just check the spikes simon: no no simon: the one Unknown: before Unknown: is randolph: it the end? randolph: he's doing it there randolph: the one before randolph: the one before randolph: that Unknown: one simon: yeah simon: yeah simon: yeah cause they both failed simon: so we're like simon: you have to go Unknown: in Unknown: is vikstar: this where he tries vikstar: to seat drop through Unknown: the Unknown: yeah simon: he tries to simon: yeah he tries to jump simon: onto the thing simon: and he holds his nose vikstar: and then falls off vikstar: holds his nose Unknown: let's vikstar: go vikstar: yeah that video did really vikstar: did really well as well right simon: yeah simon: fortunately vikstar: yeah Unknown: cause vikstar: that could have vikstar: been one that was big vikstar: budget and just vikstar: didn't go anywhere vikstar: but simon: we only found out simon: on the day as well simon: did you see how there's simon: a big gap underneath it simon: it wasn't meant to be simon: there at all randolph: okay randolph: but simon: they basically just simon: did it and said simon: there has to be a gap simon: otherwise the thing simon: will scrape and Unknown: break simon: so it kind of simon: messed us up a bit simon: it was way bigger than randolph: it should have been simon: yeah simon: need to wait vikstar: for them vikstar: to cut some bits Unknown: off simon: between the bottom simon: of vikstar: the board vikstar: and the floor vikstar: and it was actually vikstar: really bad vikstar: cause the shapes vikstar: were designed vikstar: so that you would vikstar: fit in them vikstar: if you were at the bottom vikstar: yeah vikstar: so it was like vikstar: just a slight mess up vikstar: really simon: so it's like simon: if I'm meant to simon: stand like this simon: the head piece simon: because it's moved up simon: because of that simon: is now here simon: so I have to awkwardly simon: try and jump simon: yeah vikstar: and if we were trying to vikstar: do it seriously vikstar: we would have said vikstar: this is not going to work vikstar: we can't compete vikstar: in this game vikstar: but instead vikstar: we literally just got vikstar: knocked in vikstar: and just failed vikstar: everything vikstar: it was a better video vikstar: you see where simon: mine is simon: how it's simon: I'm meant to be simon: that's meant to be simon: on the Unknown: floor vikstar: yeah simon: but obviously simon: it's like a yard above vikstar: that one worked out vikstar: better simon: it hit me square in the Unknown: head Unknown: you simon: were freezing randolph: in the simon: video simon: Josh vikstar: had a win vikstar: yeah vikstar: Josh had W host simon: to be fair though simon: he actually really simon: wanted to do Unknown: it simon: hole in the wall simon: is the one that he Unknown: was simon: wanting simon: he was like simon: hole in the wall simon: be sick simon: like it's one simon: he could have vikstar: got a Unknown: guest simon: to vikstar: host it vikstar: he didn't want that wall simon: true simon: that was freezing vikstar: I Unknown: see Unknown: do simon: you prefer the simon: big shoots simon: or Unknown: like simon: the smaller shoots simon: because me and Josh simon: realised Unknown: the simon: holiday videos simon: both of them simon: the two biggest videos simon: neither of them simon: we had a cameraman Unknown: yeah vikstar: even the simon: Europe one simon: we went to Benidorm vikstar: we simon: had a security guard simon: and that was randolph: it randolph: mad vikstar: mad vikstar: so simon: John's out of a Unknown: job vikstar: two questions there vikstar: I guess vikstar: I prefer vikstar: the more loosely formatted videos vikstar: my favourite videos vikstar: are like the travelling ones vikstar: where you get to do stuff vikstar: you just go vikstar: go with the flow Unknown: I vikstar: don't think it vikstar: makes a difference vikstar: whether we have vikstar: camera people vikstar: or cameras ourselves vikstar: because I think vikstar: we're now at the point Unknown: where Unknown: it's vikstar: we'll miss things vikstar: if we're having to vikstar: vlog it ourselves vikstar: because we Unknown: just vikstar: don't have that same vikstar: mindset simon: I think vikstar: it's good vikstar: to have a combo of both vikstar: but it's also really nice Unknown: there vikstar: are some things vikstar: like for Unknown: example vikstar: in the Europe calories Unknown: video Unknown: me, vikstar: Harry and Lana vikstar: literally sprinting vikstar: to try and find out vikstar: where this hot air balloon vikstar: is landing vikstar: we would have struggled vikstar: to vlog that vikstar: kind of thing vikstar: so it's nice vikstar: sometimes just knowing vikstar: that you can do vikstar: what you do vikstar: and I feel like vikstar: you actually get better content Unknown: for vikstar: having it shot for you Unknown: John vikstar: there we go vikstar: John celebrates vikstar: camera vikstar: so vikstar: yeah Unknown: that's vikstar: I prefer having cameras vikstar: and vikstar: my favourites vikstar: yeah vikstar: they're going out there vikstar: I'm stressed by vikstar: big studio videos randolph: because I've vikstar: had vikstar: two vikstar: two big ones vikstar: that I've been vikstar: partial organiser of vikstar: yeah vikstar: so MrBeast randolph: yeah randolph: and vikstar: then vikstar: next week's vikstar: next week's video vikstar: is a big one vikstar: yeah vikstar: so vikstar: maybe vikstar: maybe let's chill out vikstar: for a Unknown: bit randolph: yeah I remember Ethan randolph: was really stressed randolph: as well for the randolph: the escape rooms randolph: right vikstar: yeah that was a tough one vikstar: yeah because he couldn't vikstar: see them Unknown: right vikstar: so it's like randolph: a combination randolph: of like Unknown: yeah vikstar: he can randolph: organise them randolph: but he can't actually randolph: see them randolph: because he doesn't know randolph: the answer Unknown: at vikstar: the same time vikstar: I feel like vikstar: the easy solution vikstar: to that vikstar: is just vikstar: be a host vikstar: be a host vikstar: know exactly vikstar: what the things are vikstar: and randolph: just vikstar: put someone else vikstar: into play vikstar: but vikstar: I feel like it's easy vikstar: to miss vikstar: obviously vikstar: when you're making videos simon: yeah simon: I think simon: next week's video Unknown: the simon: big shoot simon: you were talking about simon: yeah simon: I think that's my favourite simon: big shoot we've Unknown: done Unknown: in simon: terms of Unknown: video vikstar: interesting simon: like I think simon: the MrBeast one simon: was a lot of fun Unknown: but Unknown: it vikstar: wasn't sight vikstar: it was vikstar: it was spectacle vikstar: but not sight vikstar: yeah simon: yeah simon: I left it thinking simon: there wasn't much personality simon: of us in Unknown: there simon: and simon: whereas this one I left simon: and I was like simon: this one Unknown: was simon: it was good simon: like really really good vikstar: very us simon: yeah simon: I think it's like simon: the perfect combination simon: of Unknown: like simon: us Unknown: and simon: production vikstar: yeah vikstar: I agree simon: so yeah simon: this week's video Unknown: banger vikstar: sick vikstar: there we go vikstar: watch it be simon: a 9 out of 10 vikstar: yeah honestly vikstar: that's the way the game goes vikstar: it's randolph: literally the way randolph: exactly the way it goes randolph: um randolph: but yeah I think randolph: oh what's Unknown: this randolph: aw randolph: culture simon: 92 simon: million simon: that's crazy Unknown: I simon: think simon: I think that as well simon: that one Unknown: is simon: that's the perfect video Unknown: in simon: terms of simon: that's Unknown: it simon: like Unknown: we simon: were on the bad team simon: but simon: it was so fun randolph: yeah Unknown: and simon: the good team simon: obviously just had like simon: an amazing Unknown: time Unknown: because simon: I know the first one simon: where you were in London simon: like Unknown: as simon: much as you mentioned simon: the bad team simon: yeah simon: we didn't actually vikstar: do anything simon: yeah simon: and I don't think you had simon: that much fun simon: that you were Unknown: like Unknown: and vikstar: the secret ingredient vikstar: is alcohol vikstar: every Sidemen video vikstar: is better randolph: yeah randolph: there's alcohol vikstar: involved vikstar: true vikstar: which is the one randolph: oh the randolph: you randolph: neither of you randolph: were there randolph: the cube Unknown: yeah vikstar: exactly vikstar: that was randolph: so bad randolph: and then we just Unknown: got randolph: like randolph: tasting it was so good vikstar: you know I organised vikstar: that whole video vikstar: yeah vikstar: and vikstar: because JJ didn't like the shoot vikstar: he had me vikstar: take a yellow card vikstar: and only get half the video vikstar: I enjoyed that video randolph: I literally randolph: I can't say anything randolph: I wasn't there randolph: I think it was because randolph: they were like randolph: ask
