I want to talk about your relationship as well
That was the core topic of today
We barely talked about it
But these are couple goals
How did you achieve couple goals?
By not trying I think
We are literally two best friends just living life
We have done the same, we are friends
Zaheer made me fall in love with cheesy lines
How did he make you fall in love?
We met at a party at Salman's house
For so many years Zaheer was getting room to be in Salman's film notebook
I also used to go there
But we never met
For 6-7 years we used to always cross each other's paths
And we never met or even saw each other
Until that one day
We had an introduction
We had some stupid talks
We made jokes
I was like ok this guy is very confident
Usually people are intimidated by me
I don't know why
At least boys at that time
I found his confidence very striking
Next day we went for tube light screening
The screening was over
After party was gathered
Zaheer and I danced
And then we went to sit in one corner
We were sitting in one corner
And literally for 5 hours
We just spoke about everything
I felt like I knew this guy
We found so many commonalities
Between the two of us
It was just beautiful
It felt like home
Was someone playing the violin?
I don't know what was happening
Literally I was just listening to him
That was the day we clicked
Since that day we have been together
When did you fall in love?
I fell in love at that first chat
You fell in love?
Within a week of knowing him
He thought I was mad
He called his best friend
I don't think she knows the meaning of love
I think she is love deprived in life
Were you?
No
I genuinely cannot explain it
I never felt this way for anyone
He said I love you
He will think I am crazy
I said what I felt
I didn't want to play games
I felt how I felt
Take it or leave it
Cut to 7 years later we are married
In a month I told him I am going to marry him
One month after meeting him
I told him I am going to marry him
What did he say?
He laughed in my face
He actually laughed in my face
I want to show the context
What is happening here?
This is an ideal relationship
Stop encouraging him
He annoys me
I just love it
He keeps you entertained
24x7
Do you think it is an underrated guy skill?
100%
There is one thing making someone laugh
You can do it for a while
But this guy has been consistently doing it for the last 8 years
Do you know what is the key?
There is consistency
That is a traditional relationship tip
Compare him to a movie character
He is my best friend
Relationships are very breakdown
In the beginning of this podcast
I told you that you are a big green flag
As a woman this is a guy's perspective
You are very chilled out
There is a balance of feminine and masculine energy
When I came into this relationship
There was such a good balance
When I reached this relationship
I realized that this is healthy
Applause comes from both hands
Love should be in both places
Respect should be in both places
Love is friendship
If there is no friendship, there is nothing
Love can fade away after so many years
But friendship is something that will always be there
Eventually you want a hangout buddy in marriage
I think so, companionship is very important
But if there is love on it, then it will be a perfect match
Are you enjoying the marriage?
I am enjoying it a lot
How long have you been dating?
We started dating in 2017
So 8 years
Out of which 1 year we have been married
All that happened in the 7th year
We got married in the 7th year
Maybe after the itch
There was just a click
That I already know this person
It was very weird
Because I didn't feel like this for anyone
Has he molded himself a bit
To be better as a partner for you?
No, I think the beauty of it is that
He lets me be and I let him be
Even if we have had our differences
We have worked our way around it
So that he can be exactly the way he is
What was your type?
My type was serious
Brutal, mature, quiet
Because I know how long you have to be away
I just didn't want to be with someone
Who I had to deal with that for
Being an actor's partner is difficult
Yes, it is
Why is it difficult?
I want my husband to not go for a shoot for a month
My husband should be with me
It is a very comfortable space
Zaheer is predominantly a real estate developer
So he is a good balance between business and acting
Thank you
