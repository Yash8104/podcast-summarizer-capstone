SPEAKER_01: They got a guy. SPEAKER_02: They have a cameraman. SPEAKER_02: Everyone has a cameraman. SPEAKER_01: And sometimes even your cameraman becomes a streamer. SPEAKER_02: Yeah.

SPEAKER_02: It's one area, right? SPEAKER_02: And can you imagine like seven eight streamers Unknown: or SPEAKER_02: people playing and then there's like fucking camera guys SPEAKER_02: like for each of those people. SPEAKER_02: That's the one thing that to me is SPEAKER_01: a little obnoxious SPEAKER_01: because it just doubles the amount of people. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: And once you're past like four, it becomes a problem. SPEAKER_01: A little SPEAKER_02: bit too crowded, in my opinion.

SPEAKER_02: But but I understand like everyone wants to share. SPEAKER_02: And that's totally, Unknown: totally SPEAKER_02: fine.

SPEAKER_01: You're like, I'm going to film myself taking a dump. Unknown: My SPEAKER_02: viewers need to know. SPEAKER_02: Meanwhile, I'm like, I'm not going to stream a single time.

SPEAKER_01: Well, I streamed like four or five days ago, SPEAKER_01: but before that 27 days Unknown: in SPEAKER_02: a month, Unknown: like SPEAKER_01: no, just 27 SPEAKER_02: days straight. SPEAKER_02: Oh, wow. SPEAKER_02: I know. Impressive. SPEAKER_02: That is very impressive. SPEAKER_02: I think it's probably the opposite of impressive. SPEAKER_01: That's very impressive to me. SPEAKER_01: But for me, maybe it is impressive. SPEAKER_01: But it's because I was sick. SPEAKER_01: I was traveling. SPEAKER_01: My brother got married, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. SPEAKER_01: What I love about there being SPEAKER_01: so many different social media platforms now is like, SPEAKER_01: you can just reach people in so many different ways. Unknown: Like SPEAKER_01: me and you on Kakao. SPEAKER_01: Clock it. SPEAKER_01: Where I message you all the fucking time. SPEAKER_01: She doesn't check Kakao messages often. SPEAKER_01: I do forget. Unknown: I SPEAKER_02: mean, I try to like Unknown: juggle SPEAKER_02: between SPEAKER_02: like Kakao and I message now, Unknown: but it's SPEAKER_02: all good. SPEAKER_02: Oh, and I bought Temmie. SPEAKER_02: You bought Temmie. SPEAKER_02: I brought Temmie to Camp Geek. SPEAKER_02: I was like, I thought Unknown: you SPEAKER_01: did that a SPEAKER_02: few SPEAKER_01: years ago. SPEAKER_02: Remember the whole streamer game thing, you know? SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah. SPEAKER_02: Where she stole the SPEAKER_01: shell. SPEAKER_01: Because Yugi kept SPEAKER_02: looking at her and saying, SPEAKER_02: yo, that's the cheater dog. Unknown: I SPEAKER_02: kept calling her Yem Yem. SPEAKER_02: I just don't. SPEAKER_02: It was so endearing. SPEAKER_02: I don't know. I let him go. SPEAKER_02: I'm like, okay. SPEAKER_02: And Jason. SPEAKER_02: Yem Yem. SPEAKER_02: The ween. SPEAKER_02: Jason, the ghouls of Jason. SPEAKER_02: I'm going to eat you. SPEAKER_02: He keeps saying that he's going to put you in the oven. SPEAKER_02: I'm going to warm you in the oven. SPEAKER_01: I'm like, that's a SPEAKER_02: very Jason thing. SPEAKER_01: The ween. SPEAKER_01: If you're listening, please, please Unknown: eat SPEAKER_01: Binky instead. Unknown: We SPEAKER_02: got to cut this narrative. SPEAKER_02: I love Binky too. SPEAKER_02: I just didn't bring it because there's two dogs. SPEAKER_02: It's way too hard to stop trying to sugar coat it. SPEAKER_02: We all know how SPEAKER_01: you're SPEAKER_02: really. SPEAKER_02: Did Swift and Temmie become friends? SPEAKER_02: No. SPEAKER_02: Swift and Temmie. SPEAKER_02: We actually put them together. SPEAKER_02: Swift starts growling. SPEAKER_02: I feel like those are complete opposites. SPEAKER_02: Temmie starts growling. SPEAKER_02: Temmie was growling. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, they both growled at each other. SPEAKER_01: They don't fuck with each other. SPEAKER_01: They don't fuck with each other, you know? SPEAKER_02: No, Temmie doesn't like dogs. SPEAKER_02: Temmie likes people. SPEAKER_01: Oh. SPEAKER_02: But otherwise, she was a huge Unknown: hit. SPEAKER_02: Everyone loved her. SPEAKER_02: It was really cute. SPEAKER_02: I'm glad I brought her. Unknown: I'm SPEAKER_02: glad you did too.

SPEAKER_01: Like the photos Unknown: looked nothing SPEAKER_01: like the place. SPEAKER_01: Did they use a fisheye zoom lens or something? SPEAKER_01: No, no, no. Unknown: It SPEAKER_01: was a different version of that apartment. SPEAKER_01: Even the bathroom that they took a photo of, SPEAKER_01: which I was very excited to film in, SPEAKER_01: we got completely different bathroom sizes SPEAKER_01: and sinks and everything. SPEAKER_01: Like of course there are different models SPEAKER_01: maybe of the same room-ish, SPEAKER_01: but one, this was a particular room SPEAKER_01: that had like two attached beds and a living room. SPEAKER_01: So I'm like, you'd anticipate that you're booking SPEAKER_01: the same one, not a version of it, SPEAKER_01: but secondly, it was just so different. SPEAKER_01: That hotel room. SPEAKER_01: And Unknown: it SPEAKER_01: was kind of funny Unknown: because SPEAKER_01: the whole place was giving haunted.

SPEAKER_01: You open to a very narrow hallway SPEAKER_01: that goes straight and then to an angle. SPEAKER_01: When I tell you it looks like SPEAKER_01: you're about to go have your kidneys harvest, SPEAKER_01: like it's for rightening. SPEAKER_01: And then I go and I had to deal with that, SPEAKER_01: bless her heart and try to figure out, SPEAKER_01: well, I ended up getting another spot for me and Janet, SPEAKER_01: and thank God I got refunded for the rest of my nights, SPEAKER_01: but it was really, have you ever gone somewhere? SPEAKER_01: And listen, I can stay, Unknown: I SPEAKER_01: can stay anywhere. SPEAKER_01: If there's a bed Unknown: and SPEAKER_01: a fucking floor, SPEAKER_01: oh, I'm gonna be fine. SPEAKER_01: When you pay like thousands expecting a place SPEAKER_01: and you get something that's the full opposite, SPEAKER_01: you know, you're a little taken aback one, SPEAKER_01: but two, have you ever been somewhere? SPEAKER_01: And you're like, Unknown: I SPEAKER_01: have a bad feeling. SPEAKER_01: Like I think someone died right there. SPEAKER_01: You know when you just feel, Unknown: have SPEAKER_01: you ever? SPEAKER_01: No. SPEAKER_01: Really? Unknown: No. SPEAKER_01: Lily has no heart, don't worry guys. SPEAKER_01: She doesn't feel those kinds of things.

SPEAKER_01: Functionways all off, the energy's Unknown: giving SPEAKER_01: me the heebie-jeebies, SPEAKER_01: but it was fine.

SPEAKER_01: I really do. SPEAKER_01: I do love SPEAKER_02: the SPEAKER_01: East Coast too. SPEAKER_01: I always want to make SPEAKER_02: a comeback. SPEAKER_02: Wait, SPEAKER_01: so do you wanna Unknown: go SPEAKER_01: maybe for a little bit? Unknown: Would SPEAKER_01: you maybe visit your parents in a month or two SPEAKER_01: and film a podcast SPEAKER_02: out there? SPEAKER_02: That could be SPEAKER_01: fun, SPEAKER_02: no? SPEAKER_01: New Jersey? SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean, I'm not going to New Jersey, SPEAKER_01: but I'll go with you for SPEAKER_02: a day. SPEAKER_02: Well, no, no, come to New Jersey. SPEAKER_02: Well, SPEAKER_01: like, I'll go to New York SPEAKER_01: and then I'll Unknown: swing SPEAKER_01: by New Jersey for a day. SPEAKER_01: Just stay in SPEAKER_02: my room.

SPEAKER_02: Like, I feel like I'm climbing a mountain SPEAKER_02: getting on that bed. SPEAKER_01: Are you not scared the ceiling's gonna like... SPEAKER_02: It just feels weird. SPEAKER_02: And then every night when I turn off the light, Unknown: there's SPEAKER_02: a Star Wars nightlight. SPEAKER_02: I can't, I don't know how to turn it off. SPEAKER_02: That's actually cute. SPEAKER_02: No, it's fucking troll-like. SPEAKER_02: I'm like, what the fuck is this? SPEAKER_02: I'm trying to switch to Star Wars.

SPEAKER_02: I think it's the same. SPEAKER_02: It's so hard to pick. SPEAKER_02: They're all so SPEAKER_01: cool. SPEAKER_01: But I think that's what makes Kata so cool. SPEAKER_01: Like, everyone's so individual. SPEAKER_01: Everyone's individual. SPEAKER_01: Man, the way, SPEAKER_01: the way that was like my vision for OTV. SPEAKER_01: I'm like, everyone has to be different. SPEAKER_01: And everyone's just Asian. SPEAKER_02: That's why she left. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, everyone was Asian. SPEAKER_02: Everyone. Unknown: Anyways. Unknown: Um, have SPEAKER_01: you heard of the Ned Fulmer podcast? Unknown: No SPEAKER_01: idea who that is. Unknown: Oh SPEAKER_01: girl, let's go down a rabbit hole. Unknown: You SPEAKER_01: definitely know who that is. SPEAKER_01: He is Unknown: the SPEAKER_01: only ex-tri-guy. SPEAKER_02: Okay, so I'm not too familiar with tri- SPEAKER_02: Okay, do you know the tri- SPEAKER_02: Yes. SPEAKER_02: It's like a SPEAKER_01: cheater trauma. SPEAKER_02: Cheater tri-guy. SPEAKER_02: And you know how I feel about SPEAKER_01: cheaters. Unknown: Yeah, why SPEAKER_01: are you looking at me, man? SPEAKER_01: And I didn't put it on the list of topics. Unknown: Clock it. SPEAKER_01: But, do you recall what happened? SPEAKER_01: He cheated on her. SPEAKER_01: So- SPEAKER_01: Like someone younger? Unknown: Dude, SPEAKER_01: you details. SPEAKER_01: One, apparently, his personality publicly SPEAKER_01: was essentially Unknown: loving SPEAKER_01: his wife. SPEAKER_01: Like his wife was his personality. SPEAKER_01: Right, I remember this. SPEAKER_02: Yes. SPEAKER_01: Holy shit. SPEAKER_01: Or like his brand, let's say. SPEAKER_01: Two, he did cheat, I believe, with someone younger. SPEAKER_01: But three, she worked at the company Unknown: under SPEAKER_01: him. Unknown: And SPEAKER_01: four, they also cheated in public. SPEAKER_02: Wow. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, okay, I remember. SPEAKER_02: Okay, I do remember this. SPEAKER_02: Sorry, go ahead. SPEAKER_01: So I'm assuming he did a podcast with his ex. SPEAKER_01: So after three years, he's back on the internet Unknown: and SPEAKER_01: the first Unknown: episode SPEAKER_01: of his podcast Unknown: is SPEAKER_01: with Unknown: his SPEAKER_01: wife. SPEAKER_01: Here was my confusion. SPEAKER_01: I thought they stayed together, Unknown: but SPEAKER_01: she said ex-wife, could we get some clarity? SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so a lot of people thought they were together, SPEAKER_00: but it turns out they have been separated for a while. SPEAKER_01: Well, that was my guess. Unknown: Fuck, SPEAKER_01: here's the thing. SPEAKER_01: We could still do it and I think we'll do it better. SPEAKER_01: I initially, I think me and many, many, many others SPEAKER_01: were initially put off by this Unknown: idea SPEAKER_01: and the clips that I saw and everything SPEAKER_01: because I thought they were still together. Unknown: But SPEAKER_01: now that I know that they're not, I'm like, oh, few. SPEAKER_01: Now it's a lot less weird and it actually kind of makes sense. Unknown: I SPEAKER_01: see. Unknown: Wait, SPEAKER_01: so why, how, wait, how was it though? Unknown: Like, SPEAKER_01: how did it Unknown: go, SPEAKER_01: like? SPEAKER_01: Girl, it was fucking awkward. SPEAKER_01: It was really- SPEAKER_01: The vibes were off? SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it was just Unknown: her saying SPEAKER_01: she really, really, really SPEAKER_01: doesn't forgive him, understandably so. SPEAKER_01: Then my guess talking about like trying to co-parent, SPEAKER_01: mind you, I have not seen the full podcast, SPEAKER_01: so I'd love to hear from Alvia or anyone who has. Unknown: I SPEAKER_01: just watch clips on TikTok, Unknown: but SPEAKER_01: it's a little bit Unknown: odd",

SPEAKER_01: I see. SPEAKER_01: I also, to be completely honest with you, SPEAKER_01: I got the impression that he primarily did this SPEAKER_01: because he felt like Unknown: from SPEAKER_01: a PR or public SPEAKER_01: or optics perspective, Unknown: it SPEAKER_01: wouldn't be acceptable for him to come back SPEAKER_01: to the internet, start making content again.

Unknown: I'm SPEAKER_01: not saying he does not have an opinion SPEAKER_01: or hasn't reflected. SPEAKER_01: Again, I haven't watched the full thing, SPEAKER_01: but from the clips I saw, Unknown: it SPEAKER_01: almost was like just watching someone publicly be Unknown: punished SPEAKER_01: in a way. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it was odd. SPEAKER_01: It seems that people are very like, SPEAKER_02: I mean, they're obviously for Ariel, SPEAKER_02: but like, he just looks a little, SPEAKER_02: not pathetic, SPEAKER_01: but you know what I mean, like very Unknown: weak. SPEAKER_01: That's what I Unknown: mean. SPEAKER_01: In a way, I'm kind of just like, SPEAKER_01: what was the purpose of this, SPEAKER_01: aside from like trying to exonerate yourself to an extent Unknown: that SPEAKER_01: you feel comfortable posting online again, Unknown: but SPEAKER_01: I also feel like it just Unknown: does SPEAKER_01: quite a fair bit SPEAKER_01: of Unknown: damage SPEAKER_01: in the same breath. SPEAKER_01: I don't SPEAKER_03: know. Unknown: Yeah, SPEAKER_01: people are not nice. SPEAKER_01: I'm reading like some, you know, reactions. Unknown: If SPEAKER_01: I was him, I wouldn't have done this SPEAKER_01: unless it felt like Unknown: his SPEAKER_01: relationship with her SPEAKER_01: was in a good enough Unknown: spot SPEAKER_01: to publicize, to be honest. SPEAKER_01: So, like, SPEAKER_02: his thing was that he's a loving husband Unknown: and SPEAKER_02: he cheats on her with Unknown: the SPEAKER_02: head of HR SPEAKER_02: under his Unknown: company. SPEAKER_02: Dude, dude, like, what? SPEAKER_02: Like, such bad decisions. SPEAKER_02: Wow. SPEAKER_02: Yep. SPEAKER_02: I'm sorry, just baffling.

SPEAKER_01: Reality is oftentimes stranger than fiction. SPEAKER_01: Oh, my God, it reminds me of the fucking, SPEAKER_01: who's that? SPEAKER_01: The CEO. SPEAKER_01: You're saying? SPEAKER_01: They're like, they're so crazy. SPEAKER_02: The audacity to SPEAKER_01: be doing this in SPEAKER_02: public. SPEAKER_01: The goal. SPEAKER_01: We clap. SPEAKER_01: The goal. SPEAKER_01: The goal. SPEAKER_01: We clap. SPEAKER_01: TwitchCon. Unknown: Are SPEAKER_01: we not going anymore? SPEAKER_01: Are we still going? SPEAKER_01: I have SPEAKER_02: an artist alley-biss, Unknown: and SPEAKER_02: we have all this stuff. SPEAKER_02: I think it's like, I have to go. SPEAKER_02: I might cancel my meeting here. SPEAKER_02: I haven't told them yet, but I might do that, SPEAKER_02: because I think a lot of people are not, Unknown: you SPEAKER_02: know. SPEAKER_02: In the mood. SPEAKER_02: I'm just not in the mood to meet people lately. SPEAKER_02: Fair enough. SPEAKER_02: I heard Ray and Cutie are not going, SPEAKER_02: and they canceled there. SPEAKER_02: When Ray told SPEAKER_01: me that, that's actually SPEAKER_02: what? SPEAKER_01: You messaged me after. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it concerned me enough to be like, SPEAKER_01: should we be concerned? SPEAKER_01: They're concerned? SPEAKER_02: We were going to do like it, Unknown: not SPEAKER_01: in person, but like SPEAKER_02: it in person, SPEAKER_02: but we decided not to SPEAKER_01: do it either, so. SPEAKER_02: I don't know, it's just Unknown: kind of SPEAKER_02: freaky, SPEAKER_01: scary Unknown: these SPEAKER_01: days. SPEAKER_01: I completely agree, and it's a tough situation SPEAKER_01: where Unknown: classic SPEAKER_01: case of like, Unknown: one SPEAKER_01: bad apple Unknown: ruins SPEAKER_01: the bunch. SPEAKER_01: I know. SPEAKER_01: That's all it takes. SPEAKER_01: And it always makes me think back to Christina Grimmie, SPEAKER_01: where it's like, me too. SPEAKER_01: It really just takes one really bad encounter. SPEAKER_02: That's the one. SPEAKER_02: You never know. SPEAKER_02: That like still like affects me. SPEAKER_02: Like she SPEAKER_01: was so SPEAKER_02: young too, 22, 23. SPEAKER_02: She was just meeting her fans after a concert. Unknown: Ooh, SPEAKER_01: okay. SPEAKER_01: It's a really dark tale to recall, SPEAKER_01: but Unknown: I SPEAKER_01: think it's worth recalling since we're on this topic, Unknown: and SPEAKER_01: especially because I recently went down SPEAKER_01: this rabbit hole regarding Christina Grimmie's passing, SPEAKER_01: because Unknown: apparently, SPEAKER_01: Glimpse of Us by Joji, SPEAKER_01: the original writers wrote that song for her. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, SPEAKER_01: which Unknown: I SPEAKER_01: was shocked to learn. SPEAKER_01: And then that song was passed on to Joji, SPEAKER_01: and he rewrote it a little bit, SPEAKER_01: and then it became less, SPEAKER_01: like it became more so about Unknown: missing SPEAKER_01: a romantic interest SPEAKER_01: when you're with another one, Unknown: but SPEAKER_01: initially the writers wrote it SPEAKER_01: because Unknown: they SPEAKER_01: were really good friends with Christina Grimmie SPEAKER_01: and simply missed her and just wanted to Unknown: find SPEAKER_01: a glimpse SPEAKER_01: of her in everyday things. Unknown: But SPEAKER_01: anyways, Unknown: when SPEAKER_01: I saw that, SPEAKER_01: because I was initially looking up the song, SPEAKER_01: and then I realized it was relating to her, SPEAKER_01: and then okay, I went down this rabbit hole SPEAKER_01: where Unknown: I SPEAKER_01: relearned about what happened. Unknown: Do SPEAKER_01: you recall the story? SPEAKER_01: She was, he was in line, right? SPEAKER_01: So she did a meet and greet, I believe, SPEAKER_01: after one of her shows, SPEAKER_01: and there was this like crazy discord stalker that she had, SPEAKER_01: and he was in line to meet her, Unknown: and he SPEAKER_01: got to the front of the line, Unknown: and SPEAKER_01: he was acting kind of like Unknown: awkward SPEAKER_01: or weird, Unknown: and SPEAKER_01: she opened her arms up to go hug him, SPEAKER_01: and that's when he shot her. SPEAKER_01: Is that not the saddest, craziest thing you've ever heard? SPEAKER_01: It sends a shiver down my spine. SPEAKER_01: Imagine Unknown: how SPEAKER_01: kind and selfless and sweet of a person she was Unknown: to SPEAKER_01: see maybe like Unknown: a SPEAKER_01: stumbling, awkward fan, SPEAKER_01: and like to open her arms up Unknown: to SPEAKER_01: him. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and then her brother tried to intervene, Unknown: and SPEAKER_01: even for her brother that must have been so traumatic, SPEAKER_01: and it makes me so sad because if you guys know me, SPEAKER_01: and you know I've been making content for years, SPEAKER_01: anytime someone recognizes me or I meet a fan, SPEAKER_01: like genuinely nothing makes me happier. SPEAKER_01: I feel like Unknown: that's SPEAKER_01: what makes me feel connected SPEAKER_01: to this social media stuff that we do, SPEAKER_01: actually meeting you guys in person, SPEAKER_01: and so I love those Unknown: organic SPEAKER_01: moments, but over the years, Unknown: and SPEAKER_01: luckily I haven't had any like Unknown: crazy SPEAKER_01: bad SPEAKER_01: in-person interactions, but I have had some weird ones. Unknown: It SPEAKER_01: just gets to a point where you're like, SPEAKER_02: sometimes it's actually Unknown: that SPEAKER_01: too, SPEAKER_01: and sometimes Unknown: it's SPEAKER_01: nicer to just meet people organically SPEAKER_01: than like Unknown: organized SPEAKER_01: meetings where if someone SPEAKER_01: that did want to know where you were, they would know. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I don't think SPEAKER_01: I'm gonna cancel Unknown: my video. Unknown: Sorry, SPEAKER_01: I don't mean to scare you. SPEAKER_01: And again, TwitchCon does tend to be, SPEAKER_01: yeah, Unknown: that's not SPEAKER_01: what you think it is. SPEAKER_01: TwitchCon does tend to be really safe, SPEAKER_01: and I think they have security, SPEAKER_01: I think they have metal detectors, et cetera. Unknown: But SPEAKER_01: honestly, the other time, sorry, SPEAKER_01: but you just never know for sure, SPEAKER_01: and if you don't feel comfortable, SPEAKER_01: you don't feel comfortable. SPEAKER_01: And I think that's how Unknown: QD, SPEAKER_01: Ray, SPEAKER_01: you and I sort of all feel right now. Unknown: The SPEAKER_01: other time that I sort of felt this way SPEAKER_01: was when I had been really outspoken SPEAKER_01: against gambling on Twitch, do you remember? SPEAKER_01: And it turned into this huge fiasco online, SPEAKER_01: which I did not think it would, SPEAKER_01: and I, Unknown: in SPEAKER_01: a way I didn't even care that much, SPEAKER_01: I was just expressing my opinion, SPEAKER_01: but the amount of vitriol and harassment SPEAKER_01: that I was getting at that time, SPEAKER_01: I don't think I explicitly said this at the time, SPEAKER_01: but that was the reason I didn't go to TwitchCon either, Unknown: because SPEAKER_01: it was like a month or two.

Unknown: But SPEAKER_02: I feel like overall, you know, SPEAKER_02: I'm okay with Unknown: giving SPEAKER_02: money in like other ways.

SPEAKER_02: Which is, SPEAKER_01: I SPEAKER_02: try to frame it like, SPEAKER_02: okay, SPEAKER_01: they must have really needed it, you know? SPEAKER_01: If someone doesn't pay you back, that's not okay, Lily. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, SPEAKER_02: but maybe they really need it. SPEAKER_02: I'm like, SPEAKER_01: okay. SPEAKER_01: How close have you gotten SPEAKER_01: into confronting someone about it? Unknown: I SPEAKER_02: don't think Unknown: I SPEAKER_02: confront that heavily. SPEAKER_02: Like, I'll just Unknown: let SPEAKER_02: it go. Unknown: At SPEAKER_02: the end of the day, SPEAKER_02: I just think, you know, maybe you need it. SPEAKER_02: Let's just move on. Unknown: And SPEAKER_02: just be more careful with lending in the future, SPEAKER_02: you know? SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Unknown: Do SPEAKER_01: you remain friends with these people? SPEAKER_01: Do you feel like your friendship changes SPEAKER_01: after they don't give you the money back? SPEAKER_02: I definitely like lose a bit of trust. Unknown: Like, SPEAKER_02: I definitely like, Unknown: I'm SPEAKER_02: like, I won't, SPEAKER_02: I probably won't lend you money like that again. Unknown: And SPEAKER_02: that's fine. SPEAKER_02: Other than that, let's just move Unknown: on. SPEAKER_02: Say la vie, what are you gonna do? SPEAKER_02: I'm not a drug dealer, man. SPEAKER_02: I'm not gonna knock on your door and be like, SPEAKER_02: yo, where's my money? SPEAKER_02: You know? SPEAKER_02: My SPEAKER_01: money, I'm not, I just SPEAKER_02: feel SPEAKER_01: weird. SPEAKER_01: I am looking up DMs between me and a content creator who, SPEAKER_01: ooh, I think I know this. SPEAKER_01: You probably do. SPEAKER_01: Who asked me and many, many, many others Unknown: for SPEAKER_01: a lot of money. SPEAKER_01: Oh yeah, I remember this. SPEAKER_01: Collective, okay, let me explain a few things. SPEAKER_01: For starters, when I first met them, SPEAKER_01: they were a very, Unknown: very SPEAKER_01: large content creator. SPEAKER_01: And the weekend that I met them, SPEAKER_01: and it was like an event convention type beat, Unknown: and he SPEAKER_01: would flex how much he was making. SPEAKER_01: He's like, oh, like just for this appearance SPEAKER_01: or just for hosting this thing, SPEAKER_01: I'm making like Unknown: $300 SPEAKER_01: ,000, blah, blah, blah. SPEAKER_01: And again, I didn't even know him like that. SPEAKER_01: So I'm like, damn, Unknown: his SPEAKER_01: pockets must be so deep, Unknown: right? SPEAKER_01: And then maybe, okay, there's a really, really weird Unknown: side SPEAKER_01: thing that happened Unknown: where SPEAKER_01: he had a conflict SPEAKER_01: with someone else and long story short. SPEAKER_01: Through that, I was a witness to it. Unknown: And SPEAKER_01: I basically found out Unknown: kind SPEAKER_01: of that he could lie SPEAKER_01: about things very easily. SPEAKER_01: He starts DMing me a lot and starts telling me SPEAKER_01: that he needs money because Unknown: tax SPEAKER_01: issues. SPEAKER_01: So I think that this was someone who ended up making SPEAKER_01: a lot of money Unknown: but SPEAKER_01: didn't manage it the best SPEAKER_01: and then owed the IRS like Unknown: a SPEAKER_01: lot. Unknown: If SPEAKER_01: you give me a couple of minutes, SPEAKER_01: I can maybe find the original texts, SPEAKER_01: but Unknown: at SPEAKER_01: some point he like asks me SPEAKER_01: for maybe a Unknown: couple SPEAKER_01: thousand or something SPEAKER_01: and I say yes, Unknown: maybe SPEAKER_01: a couple more and I'm like, okay. Unknown: And SPEAKER_01: he kept promising me the money back SPEAKER_01: but he never Unknown: repaid SPEAKER_01: me. SPEAKER_01: So when he kept asking me for more, SPEAKER_01: I was like, maybe if you paid me back to other times. Unknown: And SPEAKER_01: then he would try to Unknown: offer SPEAKER_01: me different things SPEAKER_01: for me to give him money. SPEAKER_01: Once he even sent me Unknown: like SPEAKER_01: what was supposed to be SPEAKER_01: like Unknown: a SPEAKER_01: persuasive and loving video SPEAKER_01: because he also made like YouTube videos. SPEAKER_01: So he like edited this thing SPEAKER_01: to like convince me to give him money. SPEAKER_01: Right, that's odd, right? SPEAKER_01: Anyways, once Unknown: that SPEAKER_01: didn't stop working, SPEAKER_01: sorry, once that stopped working SPEAKER_01: and I was like, listen, I've already given you, SPEAKER_01: I don't remember the exact numbers. SPEAKER_01: Maybe it was between like two to 8K, SPEAKER_01: sorry, two to 10,000. Unknown: I SPEAKER_01: was like, Unknown: maybe SPEAKER_01: in the future I can lend you more Unknown: but SPEAKER_01: you keep saying, hey, I'm gonna make these videos SPEAKER_01: and I'm gonna pay you back SPEAKER_01: but you haven't been doing it. Unknown: So SPEAKER_01: once that stopped working, Unknown: he SPEAKER_01: said, can I ask you for a favor that requires no money? Unknown: But SPEAKER_01: if you can do it, it will quite literally SPEAKER_01: pull me out of debt completely. SPEAKER_01: Every last penny, all I need is for you to hear me out SPEAKER_01: because this could be super duper easy. Unknown: I'm SPEAKER_01: actually not sure. SPEAKER_01: I said, Unknown: what SPEAKER_01: is it? Unknown: He SPEAKER_01: goes, okay, is there anyone you know SPEAKER_01: that can help me get an account verified? SPEAKER_01: Because if I help this game dev get verified, SPEAKER_01: he's going to give me potentially $200,000 Unknown: which SPEAKER_01: will go to paying off my debts. Unknown: I SPEAKER_01: said, LMAO what? SPEAKER_01: Listen, one, why do you think I can get someone verified? SPEAKER_01: I don't work at Twitter. SPEAKER_01: She's Pokemon. SPEAKER_01: Two, someone's paying you $200,000 to get verified? SPEAKER_01: Three, where's my cut? SPEAKER_01: If that were to occur. SPEAKER_01: Anyways, I literally say LMAO what? SPEAKER_01: He goes, LOL, I know. Unknown: I SPEAKER_01: almost just said that. Unknown: I SPEAKER_01: said, how much debt are you in right now? Unknown: They SPEAKER_01: said, maybe around 25,000 to people SPEAKER_01: and 75 to the IRS SPEAKER_01: but I've been paying monthly for a few years now SPEAKER_01: so this would abolish both. SPEAKER_01: I'm like, so you're just trying to make a hundred, SPEAKER_01: can't you're not even offering me? SPEAKER_01: So like, off the top, whatever. SPEAKER_01: Guys, I have not reread these messages in years SPEAKER_01: so Unknown: look SPEAKER_01: here, I'm like. SPEAKER_03: This is kind SPEAKER_01: of hilarious because I'm Unknown: a little, SPEAKER_01: I am very upfront, I'll say that much. SPEAKER_01: And we love that about you. SPEAKER_01: Do you SPEAKER_03: want to read my second response? Unknown: Bro, SPEAKER_02: just work on your craft SPEAKER_02: and get the money back slowly. SPEAKER_02: I ain't Twitter, I can't verify shit. Unknown: And SPEAKER_02: then he says, darn. Unknown: And SPEAKER_02: then Unknown: she SPEAKER_02: says, SPEAKER_02: but I don't recommend trying to get Unknown: rich, SPEAKER_02: quick schemes. SPEAKER_02: Don't trust someone who's giving 200K to get verified. SPEAKER_02: Clearly. SPEAKER_01: Anyways, oh fuck, it scrolled up. SPEAKER_01: But literally as I told you guys, I said, Unknown: I was SPEAKER_01: like, I'm not Twitter, I can't do shit. SPEAKER_01: And Unknown: this SPEAKER_01: is someone again who like has a big following online. SPEAKER_01: I'm like, Unknown: just SPEAKER_01: work, like you can pay off all of this money. SPEAKER_01: But I think Unknown: that SPEAKER_01: wasn't really the issue here. SPEAKER_01: If you know what I mean. SPEAKER_01: I said, yeah, I ain't Twitter, I can't verify shit, SPEAKER_01: but I don't recommend trying to do get rich, quick schemes. SPEAKER_01: Like also who the hell is gonna pay 200K to get verified? SPEAKER_01: They're gonna get verified and be like, got them. SPEAKER_01: Anyways, I think that's basically it. SPEAKER_01: He never paid me back, SPEAKER_01: but at least I didn't lose like more money to him, you know? SPEAKER_01: It was just the initial. SPEAKER_01: And as he kept asking for stuff, Unknown: and SPEAKER_01: it's especially tough because it's always like, SPEAKER_01: you can save me, you can make such a difference. SPEAKER_01: Like he really knows how to make people SPEAKER_01: feel good about themselves. Unknown: She SPEAKER_01: said no. Unknown: Crazy. SPEAKER_01: Anyways. SPEAKER_02: Sometimes, you know, SPEAKER_02: you know, even doing content creation for so long, Unknown: you SPEAKER_02: see people come and go all the time. SPEAKER_02: And I remember certain names, like how Unknown: big, SPEAKER_02: how Unknown: popular, SPEAKER_02: influential, wealthy, SPEAKER_02: or whatever someone used to be. SPEAKER_02: And then like, then I see Unknown: stuff SPEAKER_02: like that, which is... SPEAKER_02: Did you know who it was already? SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I remember this. SPEAKER_02: You told me about this, yeah. SPEAKER_02: I SPEAKER_01: heard SPEAKER_02: through other people too, SPEAKER_02: that Unknown: he SPEAKER_01: was asking a lot of people for money. SPEAKER_01: People just SPEAKER_02: for money, yeah. SPEAKER_01: And he's not the only one. SPEAKER_01: I think I've come across maybe like three creators SPEAKER_01: throughout my time Unknown: that SPEAKER_01: ended up doing that SPEAKER_01: in like different crowds. Unknown: I SPEAKER_01: think between friends, SPEAKER_01: luckily I haven't really had like really good friends. SPEAKER_01: Not many of my friends Unknown: have SPEAKER_01: asked me for money. SPEAKER_02: But you can bet if I ever need money, SPEAKER_02: I will knock on her DMs. SPEAKER_02: Yeah. SPEAKER_02: No, but the thing is like, if you need money, SPEAKER_02: I would just let you live with me. SPEAKER_01: You can have my bank account, I don't care. SPEAKER_01: Oh my SPEAKER_02: God. SPEAKER_01: I wouldn't even like loan. SPEAKER_01: I wouldn't like loan too, I don't like that, yeah. SPEAKER_01: Thank you, I'm gonna gamble it all now. SPEAKER_01: I really do feel like, Unknown: especially SPEAKER_01: depending on where you live, SPEAKER_01: if you don't feel like you can entirely trust SPEAKER_01: your government to take care of you, SPEAKER_01: I feel like you need to kind of create SPEAKER_01: these like socialist circles where it's like, SPEAKER_01: you got me, you got me, yeah, right? SPEAKER_02: Like just in case. SPEAKER_02: I do do that a lot. SPEAKER_02: I feel like that's the best SPEAKER_01: you can do. SPEAKER_01: I always talk to Ludwig, I'm always telling him, SPEAKER_01: hey, Unknown: if SPEAKER_01: I ever want to quit everything, SPEAKER_01: it's just so true. SPEAKER_01: Sometimes Lily will be texting me SPEAKER_01: and she'll Unknown: be SPEAKER_01: having some sort of crisis. SPEAKER_01: She'll be like, I just messaged Ludwig SPEAKER_01: and asked if I could get a job. SPEAKER_01: And like, I think that's so cute, SPEAKER_01: but I'm like, I wasn't your first choice, you bitch. SPEAKER_01: It's because he has a job available. SPEAKER_01: That's true, he does have a full-on company. SPEAKER_01: Yes, and that's why SPEAKER_02: I was like, SPEAKER_02: oh, you have a company, can I work for your company? SPEAKER_02: I'm like, I can be competent SPEAKER_02: and he's like, you don't even need to be competent. SPEAKER_02: Okay. Unknown: And SPEAKER_02: he's like, yeah, you can play piano for me SPEAKER_02: when I'm starting my stream. SPEAKER_01: Ludwig would be lucky to hire you, SPEAKER_01: I'll tell you that much. Unknown: He SPEAKER_01: seems pretty chill. SPEAKER_01: I have had a couple Unknown: issues, Unknown: like SPEAKER_01: doing work-related things with friends. SPEAKER_01: I'm not sure how I feel about that. SPEAKER_01: And let me preface, when I say that, SPEAKER_01: I mean employing people that are not Unknown: in SPEAKER_01: this sphere. SPEAKER_01: I don't mean streamer friends. Unknown: If I SPEAKER_01: met you through streaming, SPEAKER_01: our relationship is already Unknown: to SPEAKER_01: some degree business, SPEAKER_01: but I mean people who like I was just friends with before, SPEAKER_01: but then I'm like, oh, maybe this opportunity comes along. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you want to give your friend a job. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I understand that, I've done it. SPEAKER_01: There have been some instances where like, SPEAKER_01: I know someone kind of needs money, SPEAKER_01: so I just Unknown: overpay SPEAKER_01: them to the extreme, Unknown: which SPEAKER_01: I don't mind at all. SPEAKER_01: To me, it's almost like a loophole, SPEAKER_01: like I get to give you money, Unknown: and like SPEAKER_01: that's legal. SPEAKER_01: But unfortunately, Unknown: in SPEAKER_01: most, if not every one of those instances, SPEAKER_01: I am not Unknown: too, SPEAKER_01: I don't want to say I'm not happy with the work. Unknown: I'm SPEAKER_01: not happy with the level of effort. SPEAKER_01: Like, I know Unknown: whatever SPEAKER_01: work Unknown: comes SPEAKER_01: out of a project Unknown: isn't SPEAKER_01: always going to be what you expect, Unknown: but SPEAKER_01: at the very least, if I'm friends with someone, SPEAKER_01: if we have some level of understanding, SPEAKER_01: if also I'm trying so hard Unknown: to SPEAKER_01: frankly overpay them for something, Unknown: at SPEAKER_01: the very least, I just want to feel like they're really trying. Unknown: I SPEAKER_02: think it's like a, wow, SPEAKER_02: so like Unknown: it SPEAKER_02: should be that, SPEAKER_02: oh, you gave someone this really good opportunity SPEAKER_02: because they're your friend and you are overpaying them. SPEAKER_02: They should, I feel like they should also work hard to like, SPEAKER_02: you know, be like, oh, you know, really great. SPEAKER_02: At least try, yeah. SPEAKER_02: Exactly, but I feel like oftentimes it goes Unknown: the SPEAKER_02: opposite way. SPEAKER_02: But they take it for granted. SPEAKER_02: Oh, she's a friend. SPEAKER_02: Like, you know, she'll understand, like, it goes opposite. SPEAKER_02: I've Unknown: been SPEAKER_02: through that too, where I'm SPEAKER_01: like, uh, uh, SPEAKER_02: uh. Unknown: Yeah, SPEAKER_01: I think I kind of learned, SPEAKER_01: like sometimes Unknown: in SPEAKER_01: an effort to be nice, SPEAKER_01: you end up presenting yourself as someone SPEAKER_01: who's easy to take advantage of, SPEAKER_01: even if people Unknown: aren't SPEAKER_01: actively and intentionally thinking, SPEAKER_01: let me take advantage. SPEAKER_01: They're like, oh, she's being easygoing. SPEAKER_01: So if I don't put that much effort, SPEAKER_01: she'll still be easygoing. SPEAKER_01: But it's like, SPEAKER_02: I'm going to take advantage of someone. SPEAKER_02: Like nobody SPEAKER_01: really thinks that they don't, SPEAKER_01: I think oftentimes you don't even realize. Unknown: Ah, SPEAKER_01: I think I told you, SPEAKER_01: I ended up in this Unknown: situation SPEAKER_01: of sorts SPEAKER_01: where I was paying someone Unknown: monthly SPEAKER_01: to help me SPEAKER_01: and then I didn't really need their help SPEAKER_01: for a specific month. SPEAKER_01: So my team like decided, SPEAKER_01: okay, Unknown: like we're SPEAKER_01: going to end the working relationship here. Unknown: And SPEAKER_01: then when we tried to communicate that to that person, SPEAKER_01: because we have like a personal relationship, SPEAKER_01: they were speaking to my manager Unknown: and SPEAKER_01: they said like, SPEAKER_01: oh, I'm going to go ask Poki SPEAKER_01: if she can pay me for an extra month SPEAKER_01: because well, like I have bills Unknown: and SPEAKER_02: like that's that. SPEAKER_01: And Unknown: it SPEAKER_01: was a little bit Unknown: awkward SPEAKER_01: sort of SPEAKER_01: because like from a company perspective, SPEAKER_01: it's like, well, like Unknown: we SPEAKER_01: just don't need the services SPEAKER_01: that we're Unknown: contracting SPEAKER_01: you for. SPEAKER_01: I think that's why they say don't mix business with friends SPEAKER_01: for this reason. SPEAKER_01: But, you know, if Unknown: a SPEAKER_01: friend is like, SPEAKER_01: well, Unknown: like the SPEAKER_01: money would be nice. Unknown: Yeah, SPEAKER_01: I also know that. SPEAKER_01: Exactly. So Unknown: I SPEAKER_01: was like, okay, SPEAKER_01: we'll just pay you for the extra month. SPEAKER_01: And then basically they were managing Unknown: one project SPEAKER_01: and we didn't give them any other work. SPEAKER_01: And the project Unknown: ended SPEAKER_01: up, SPEAKER_01: I mean, it's their kind of responsibility to manage SPEAKER_01: and it took a little bit longer than the month SPEAKER_01: because of delays that were Unknown: out SPEAKER_01: of my hand, SPEAKER_01: whatever was going on on their end. SPEAKER_01: And essentially as soon as it passed the official month date Unknown: and SPEAKER_01: they like showed me it SPEAKER_01: and we had to do a round of feedback, SPEAKER_01: they're like, okay, I'll be charging you hourly now for that. SPEAKER_01: And that Unknown: kind SPEAKER_01: of put me off because I was like, SPEAKER_01: I didn't even need to pay you for this entire month, technically. SPEAKER_01: And like the moment that we're beyond it Unknown: for SPEAKER_01: delays that are not my fault SPEAKER_01: and in a way are kind of your responsibility SPEAKER_01: since you're managing this. SPEAKER_01: And you promised me a due date that was weeks ago. SPEAKER_01: I need to pay more because of that too. SPEAKER_01: And it just felt like, okay, SPEAKER_01: I was willing Unknown: to SPEAKER_01: contract you for longer SPEAKER_01: and pay you for longer because you're my friend. Unknown: But SPEAKER_01: now that I just want you to like SPEAKER_01: wrap the project and it's a little bit past the retainer date, SPEAKER_01: you're not willing to do that for me as a friend. SPEAKER_01: And it felt kind of infusing. SPEAKER_01: Do you get what I mean? SPEAKER_01: I understand. SPEAKER_01: It's Unknown: so... SPEAKER_01: Yeah, SPEAKER_02: that Unknown: working SPEAKER_02: with friends I feel SPEAKER_02: is Unknown: sometimes SPEAKER_02: a dice roll SPEAKER_02: because you have to manage like your personal relationship SPEAKER_02: but also you are paying them to do something Unknown: but SPEAKER_02: when that gets really like messy and blurry, Unknown: I SPEAKER_02: think it's Unknown: personal SPEAKER_02: preference SPEAKER_02: how you want to go about it, you know? SPEAKER_02: Yeah, SPEAKER_01: I think what that taught me is Unknown: you SPEAKER_01: could be friends with someone for a very long time Unknown: but SPEAKER_01: how someone does business SPEAKER_01: tends to be completely different. SPEAKER_01: That's also very true. SPEAKER_01: Like you would really, really be surprised. SPEAKER_01: I'll take it a step further. SPEAKER_01: Let me tell you about working with family. SPEAKER_01: Wait, can I interject quickly? SPEAKER_01: Okay, I'm sorry. SPEAKER_01: Just to wrap this up, sorry. SPEAKER_01: I wasn't SPEAKER_02: actually SPEAKER_01: gonna... SPEAKER_01: Well, you could but SPEAKER_01: because I'm sure that has its own complications too. SPEAKER_01: Oh yeah, we can hear from both ends. SPEAKER_01: Oh, I was just gonna say, SPEAKER_01: I spoke to my therapist about this SPEAKER_01: and they really clocked me. SPEAKER_01: They basically said like, SPEAKER_01: oh, these people like that are your friends SPEAKER_01: that you're really looking to help. Unknown: You SPEAKER_01: know, let's say they're XYZ age SPEAKER_01: or in whatever situations SPEAKER_01: and they can't hold a stable job SPEAKER_01: and like you're trying to be there Unknown: and SPEAKER_01: provide a source of income for them. SPEAKER_01: You have these expectations of them SPEAKER_01: when it comes to work, SPEAKER_01: but don't you think Unknown: if SPEAKER_01: they were that competent, SPEAKER_01: they maybe wouldn't have wound up SPEAKER_01: in that position in a way? SPEAKER_01: I was like, shit. SPEAKER_01: Like maybe they wouldn't really be needing SPEAKER_01: your help to this extent SPEAKER_01: if like they just really did good work. Unknown: I SPEAKER_01: was like, oh, that's a fucking loaded question. SPEAKER_02: Anyways. SPEAKER_02: I talked a little about this with Ludwig SPEAKER_02: actually the past, like he employs his friends SPEAKER_02: and like it's just a, he employs a lot of people. SPEAKER_02: He sure does, yeah. SPEAKER_02: And some of them are like, they go above and beyond. SPEAKER_02: Like they're like Unknown: fucking SPEAKER_02: stars. SPEAKER_01: But some of them might not like quite make the activity. SPEAKER_01: There's SPEAKER_02: like, you know. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, SPEAKER_01: depends how someone is with business and work, truly. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's kind of interesting in a way. SPEAKER_02: Business makes things SPEAKER_01: complicated, SPEAKER_02: especially when you make personal feelings into it. SPEAKER_02: I think navigating that is just so fucking hard. SPEAKER_02: Yeah. SPEAKER_02: Like it's not SPEAKER_01: easy. SPEAKER_01: And I feel like I just really learned SPEAKER_01: like it's almost like someone has a Unknown: personal SPEAKER_01: friend face SPEAKER_01: and they have a business face Unknown: and SPEAKER_01: they maybe have like a romantic relationships face. SPEAKER_01: Like people just have different facets to them SPEAKER_01: depending on Unknown: the SPEAKER_01: thing, yeah? SPEAKER_01: Couples that work together are fascinating to me. SPEAKER_01: I'm like, man, how is SPEAKER_02: your relationship intact? SPEAKER_01: Actually, SPEAKER_02: it's SPEAKER_01: kind of like. SPEAKER_01: Oh, sorry. SPEAKER_02: I completely forgot SPEAKER_01: they kind of work together. SPEAKER_01: Actually, y'all seem fine. SPEAKER_01: Thank God. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: Like Annie Albert. Unknown: Box, SPEAKER_01: box. SPEAKER_01: There's a lot of people. SPEAKER_01: There's a lot of couples that work together. SPEAKER_01: To be honest, I think I'm someone SPEAKER_01: who it probably would not work for me SPEAKER_01: because I have kooky, kooky part in my language, SPEAKER_01: anal expectations when it comes to work. SPEAKER_01: I don't want to put that on my partner. SPEAKER_01: Maybe in like low lift Unknown: ways, SPEAKER_01: like a little thing here and there. SPEAKER_01: Okay, but like working with them all the time. SPEAKER_01: It's hard. SPEAKER_01: Good Lord, no. SPEAKER_01: I SPEAKER_02: have Michael, SPEAKER_01: whichever work SPEAKER_02: with SPEAKER_01: me. SPEAKER_01: And he's like, Unknown: fuck no. SPEAKER_02: And I'm like, you know what? SPEAKER_02: That's my answer SPEAKER_01: too. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, tell them. SPEAKER_01: Yeah. SPEAKER_01: Tom, you're gonna go work for me at Ludwig. SPEAKER_01: What? SPEAKER_01: It also reminds me of like, SPEAKER_01: you know how sometimes you can be friends with, SPEAKER_01: I think more so a guy than a girl. SPEAKER_01: I feel like I know my girlfriends pretty well, SPEAKER_01: but sometimes like I could know a guy, SPEAKER_01: but I could have no idea what he's like in a relationship. SPEAKER_03: Like SPEAKER_01: that could be a completely different side to him SPEAKER_01: where I would be like surprised or confused or like, SPEAKER_01: there's some guys like I maybe just game with. SPEAKER_01: So I feel like I only know one facet of them. SPEAKER_01: I could hear relationship stories about them SPEAKER_01: and be like, whoa. SPEAKER_01: And then I have to like reconcile the two. SPEAKER_01: That's what I'm learning about SPEAKER_01: mixing Unknown: friends SPEAKER_01: and business. SPEAKER_01: Like if you don't know that side, it could be anything. SPEAKER_01: Speaking of like business SPEAKER_02: and SPEAKER_01: friends, I just feel like- SPEAKER_01: Shall we SPEAKER_02: kiss? SPEAKER_02: Huh? SPEAKER_02: We are friends who do business. SPEAKER_01: Anyways, you were gonna say? SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we SPEAKER_02: do do business. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we do. SPEAKER_02: But hasn't SPEAKER_01: imploded yet. SPEAKER_01: So thank SPEAKER_02: God. SPEAKER_02: Knock on wood. SPEAKER_02: Waiting for SPEAKER_01: that big one, you know, SPEAKER_01: it's like an earthquake. SPEAKER_01: I SPEAKER_02: don't anticipate it, I really don't. SPEAKER_02: There's like streamer friendships SPEAKER_02: is what I consider mixing business SPEAKER_02: with friendship quite often. Unknown: And SPEAKER_02: you know, I've talked about this before SPEAKER_02: where it took me a long time to realize SPEAKER_02: like if you just treat it as like a purely streamer relationship, SPEAKER_02: I will be much happier in the long run SPEAKER_02: because I won't have expectations SPEAKER_02: and they don't have expectations SPEAKER_02: instead of like Unknown: putting SPEAKER_02: my personal feelings onto that. SPEAKER_02: But it's a lot of like, Unknown: it's SPEAKER_02: a lot of that. SPEAKER_02: Who would SPEAKER_01: have thunk that like Unknown: streamer SPEAKER_01: friends SPEAKER_01: kind of aren't like your friends? SPEAKER_01: They really? SPEAKER_01: I did not. SPEAKER_01: I didn't think that for a long time. SPEAKER_01: And no one told me. SPEAKER_01: Me too, I thought- SPEAKER_01: Guys, no one told- SPEAKER_01: Can I put that on? SPEAKER_01: No one told me. SPEAKER_01: These people are not your friends. SPEAKER_01: But you think- SPEAKER_01: Well, I mean, when SPEAKER_02: you're younger- SPEAKER_01: Except SPEAKER_02: you and me. SPEAKER_02: That doesn't- SPEAKER_02: Right? SPEAKER_02: Are we?

SPEAKER_02: And you're like- SPEAKER_02: I'm gonna play on games with people SPEAKER_02: if I like, I don't know, eight hours a day. SPEAKER_02: And then, SPEAKER_01: you know, I can't help it, they're my friends. SPEAKER_01: But SPEAKER_02: we're not friends. SPEAKER_02: It's really- SPEAKER_02: It's just like, people are different. SPEAKER_02: You gotta hang with people off stream. SPEAKER_02: Stuff like that, yeah. SPEAKER_02: No, I'll tell you the truth. SPEAKER_01: Why does SPEAKER_02: she sound like a pastor? SPEAKER_02: You just said it. SPEAKER_02: No, I really did. SPEAKER_02: I really did. SPEAKER_01: You would say everything's so sweet, SPEAKER_01: but to me it's Unknown: like SPEAKER_01: - Unknown: That's SPEAKER_01: how we're sweet and sour. SPEAKER_01: I think it's mixed signals frequently SPEAKER_01: when you make some, when you make content with someone SPEAKER_01: and like, they act so hunky dory. SPEAKER_01: They act like your friends, SPEAKER_01: but it's like, bitch, I didn't know it was acted. SPEAKER_01: No one said cut Unknown: before SPEAKER_02: you cut me. SPEAKER_02: Wow, that was- SPEAKER_02: Anyways, let's do one of the deepest things SPEAKER_02: you've ever said. SPEAKER_02: That was pretty deep. SPEAKER_02: Thank you so much. SPEAKER_01: That was SPEAKER_02: deep. SPEAKER_02: Thank you so much. SPEAKER_01: Anyways, let's wrap it up with a song. SPEAKER_01: No, SPEAKER_02: just to be on a really long time, SPEAKER_01: I'm glad that Unknown: we SPEAKER_01: both went on that journey SPEAKER_01: because I really, at one point I hit a brick wall SPEAKER_01: where I was like, who are my friends? SPEAKER_01: Not just that, but like, SPEAKER_01: is everybody not friends with each other? SPEAKER_01: I think more people- SPEAKER_01: It's fucking weird out here. SPEAKER_01: I think more people didn't SPEAKER_02: realize SPEAKER_02: I had just SPEAKER_01: acquaintances and coworkers, SPEAKER_01: which is fun! SPEAKER_01: The real friendships are actually the minority, SPEAKER_01: if anything. SPEAKER_01: Most people are just like- SPEAKER_02: Oh, SPEAKER_01: I took that so wrong. SPEAKER_01: Wait, what? SPEAKER_01: Nothing. SPEAKER_01: I'm like, are you're just friends with minorities? SPEAKER_01: What Unknown: the fuck? SPEAKER_01: We are only friends SPEAKER_02: with SPEAKER_01: minorities. SPEAKER_02: Is that why? SPEAKER_02: Am I your DEI friend hire? SPEAKER_02: You do SPEAKER_01: fall into a couple of SPEAKER_02: categories. SPEAKER_02: I'm a Korean SPEAKER_01: friend. SPEAKER_01: I'm competing with Celine, actually. SPEAKER_01: Actually, you know what's funny? SPEAKER_01: The other day, someone thought that SPEAKER_01: someone was talking to me SPEAKER_01: and they thought that you were Chinese. SPEAKER_01: I was like, no, she's Korean. SPEAKER_01: They said, isn't Chu a Chinese class name? SPEAKER_01: I said no, her last name's not Chu. SPEAKER_01: It's quite common, SPEAKER_02: it's Pichu. SPEAKER_02: Pichu is not under any- SPEAKER_02: I just thought that was so funny. SPEAKER_02: It's actually quite Nintendo, SPEAKER_02: but we don't say that because they'll sue me one day. SPEAKER_02: Okay, let's wrap it up with a soul-ass. SPEAKER_02: Hell, heck yeah. SPEAKER_02: Heck yeah. SPEAKER_02: You read it, I feel like you're in the mood to read. SPEAKER_02: Hello, Lily Pokey and team. SPEAKER_02: Hey. SPEAKER_02: I'm gonna practice my little voice. Unknown: Love SPEAKER_02: the pod, y'all are so cute. SPEAKER_01: Love you too. SPEAKER_02: By SPEAKER_01: the SPEAKER_02: way, Lily, I have been watching Witchwatch SPEAKER_02: and you do a fantastic job. SPEAKER_02: Really enjoying the show and your performance. SPEAKER_02: Hey, thanks, that really means a lot. SPEAKER_02: I haven't gotten any single new voice role SPEAKER_02: in months and I'm so fucking depressed about that. SPEAKER_02: Actually, SPEAKER_01: I think about it every SPEAKER_02: day. SPEAKER_02: I was wondering how you would recommend SPEAKER_02: balancing financials and friendship. SPEAKER_02: I have a friend who is very bad with her money, 25F, Unknown: and SPEAKER_02: I'm a recent graduate with an engineering degree SPEAKER_02: and have been working full-time with a decent salary SPEAKER_02: for the last year at 23F. SPEAKER_02: Well, look at you. SPEAKER_02: This friend is pregnant and is not financially stable. SPEAKER_02: Her boyfriend needs to work at some dead-end job SPEAKER_02: at a dollar general. SPEAKER_02: I think he might be unemployed now. SPEAKER_02: She is working as a daycare preschool teacher. SPEAKER_02: I have given her over $200 in the past SPEAKER_02: before she became pregnant SPEAKER_02: since she doesn't have much financial help from her family SPEAKER_02: and I am fairly stable. SPEAKER_02: I don't expect to see that money again Unknown: and SPEAKER_02: that is fine. SPEAKER_02: She recently messaged me saying her and her boyfriend SPEAKER_02: have no money for gas. SPEAKER_02: I, of course, Unknown: want SPEAKER_02: to help and have Venmoed her SPEAKER_02: some more funds, but at what point do I stop? SPEAKER_02: I worry about her. SPEAKER_02: She's not, Unknown: I SPEAKER_02: worry about her SPEAKER_02: and she is not ready for a child. SPEAKER_02: I've never met the BF, Unknown: but I've SPEAKER_02: not heard great things about him. SPEAKER_02: I don't think he's helping her financially, emotionally. SPEAKER_02: I'm just not sure where to go. SPEAKER_02: Do I keep sending her money? SPEAKER_02: As she asks, I haven't really interacted with her SPEAKER_02: since I graduated over Unknown: a SPEAKER_02: year ago SPEAKER_02: since I now live quite a ways away SPEAKER_02: and I seem to only get messages when she needs money. Unknown: That SPEAKER_02: is Unknown: sad. SPEAKER_02: It makes me feel like a bank SPEAKER_02: or at least a sugar daddy stuck in a young woman's body SPEAKER_02: just without the financials law. Unknown: I SPEAKER_02: like that call SPEAKER_01: back. SPEAKER_02: Just wondering if at some point I should tell her, SPEAKER_02: no, and at one point I should do that. SPEAKER_02: How do I do it in a way that is helpful SPEAKER_02: without being hurtful? SPEAKER_02: I mean, you're out of college with student loans, SPEAKER_02: a home loan with my partner, SPEAKER_02: a dog and cat to care for. SPEAKER_02: It's not like dishing out another $50 is impossible. SPEAKER_02: It's just not ideal to keep doing it SPEAKER_02: and in the long run won't help her fix her financials. SPEAKER_02: I, of course, I will give her money for gas SPEAKER_02: so she can make it to work, SPEAKER_02: but I can't support her entirely. SPEAKER_02: Thanks. SPEAKER_02: Keep releasing podcasts until I retire, please. SPEAKER_02: Engineering is very boring sometimes SPEAKER_02: and any good you have me to listen to, SPEAKER_02: that'll be at least another 35. SPEAKER_02: 40 years. SPEAKER_02: We got you. SPEAKER_02: That is such a sweet comment. SPEAKER_02: What is it? SPEAKER_02: Like, that's so sweet. SPEAKER_02: Well, first of all, I am sorry you feel like Unknown: a SPEAKER_02: bank. SPEAKER_02: I know the feeling you want to help your friend. SPEAKER_02: You know, it's not like- SPEAKER_02: I'm not sure you're like a SPEAKER_01: bank all the time. SPEAKER_02: Huh? SPEAKER_02: Huh? SPEAKER_02: What? Unknown: Are SPEAKER_02: you? Unknown: I'm SPEAKER_02: joking. SPEAKER_02: My love. SPEAKER_02: Wait, wait, wait. SPEAKER_02: Go on, go on. SPEAKER_02: I am really hungry. SPEAKER_02: If you could buy me a food after Unknown: this. SPEAKER_02: I'm down. SPEAKER_02: I'm joking. SPEAKER_02: I'm joking. SPEAKER_02: Generally, SPEAKER_01: I'm down. SPEAKER_02: Like, you do, you know that saying SPEAKER_02: you can't set yourself on fire. SPEAKER_02: To keep someone else warm. SPEAKER_01: I SPEAKER_02: do think that applies here. SPEAKER_02: You can't keep hurting yourself. SPEAKER_02: I will SPEAKER_01: say it's so sweet. SPEAKER_01: Like, I can tell how much you care SPEAKER_01: through this message and you're really trying. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the kindness isn't wrong. Unknown: But SPEAKER_02: you do need to take care of yourself. SPEAKER_02: Maybe you can like help her Unknown: with SPEAKER_02: like finding a job SPEAKER_02: or like a more concrete long-term way. SPEAKER_02: Teach a man SPEAKER_01: how to fish. SPEAKER_01: Instead of give him a fish. SPEAKER_01: Is that to say? SPEAKER_02: Maybe you could try that. SPEAKER_02: Like, hey, is there anything I can help SPEAKER_02: you out like, you know, Unknown: to SPEAKER_02: find a job SPEAKER_02: or like to prep for your Unknown: child, SPEAKER_02: etc. SPEAKER_02: Relationship stuff is hard to comment on SPEAKER_02: because that's their relationship. SPEAKER_02: You don't know the ins and outs of that. SPEAKER_02: What do you think? SPEAKER_02: I teach a man to SPEAKER_01: fish. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think. Unknown: I SPEAKER_01: also think for your sake and for hers, SPEAKER_01: it's good for you to set maybe like a mental limit SPEAKER_01: of how much Unknown: you're SPEAKER_01: willing to give her SPEAKER_01: maybe even a month. Unknown: And SPEAKER_01: I think one of the best ways SPEAKER_01: you can communicate this is like, SPEAKER_01: hey, Unknown: I SPEAKER_01: care for you so much. SPEAKER_01: I want to help. SPEAKER_01: I've been trying to help, Unknown: but SPEAKER_01: I have a home loan. SPEAKER_01: I have student loans. SPEAKER_01: You know, I need to be financially smart SPEAKER_01: and budget for myself. SPEAKER_01: I could maybe help you out with this much, SPEAKER_01: at least for the next three months. SPEAKER_01: And hopefully by then, Unknown: you SPEAKER_01: can try to be set up in a way SPEAKER_01: where you don't need to lean on me. SPEAKER_01: Unfortunately, from my personal experience, SPEAKER_01: I feel like sometimes when people ask for money, Unknown: and SPEAKER_01: you get in the habit of saying yes, Unknown: they SPEAKER_01: get in the habit of expecting that Unknown: almost SPEAKER_01: like as a source of income. SPEAKER_01: And I think if you keep giving, SPEAKER_01: like Unknown: you SPEAKER_01: feel a certain way now, SPEAKER_01: but I'm sure at some point, SPEAKER_01: it's going to build up and lead to resentment, SPEAKER_01: which is not going to be healthy. Unknown: I SPEAKER_01: will say before you have some sort of SPEAKER_01: conversation with her, Unknown: please SPEAKER_01: keep in mind if it goes sour, SPEAKER_01: it is not your fault. Unknown: And I SPEAKER_01: feel like you're really trying, SPEAKER_01: and I think as much, SPEAKER_01: like Unknown: as SPEAKER_01: long as you're being nice and caring, SPEAKER_01: it's not your fault. SPEAKER_01: If someone doesn't want to be your friend, SPEAKER_01: or Unknown: wants SPEAKER_01: to stop being your friend SPEAKER_01: because you don't want to give them money, Unknown: as SPEAKER_01: sad as it is, SPEAKER_01: probably better off ending the friendship. Unknown: Okay, SPEAKER_01: that's a lot of experience. SPEAKER_01: Too much. SPEAKER_01: I'm like, I'm also like a fucking 45-year-old SPEAKER_01: stuck in a Unknown: sexy SPEAKER_01: 29-year-old bot. SPEAKER_01: Anyway, SPEAKER_02: your willingness to help your friend, SPEAKER_02: I think is really, Unknown: it's SPEAKER_02: like really pure. SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I can, SPEAKER_02: even just the way you're writing this. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, SPEAKER_01: it's, Unknown: you SPEAKER_01: are more selfless than most, SPEAKER_01: I'll say that much. SPEAKER_02: Yeah, Unknown: and SPEAKER_02: I know what you say, SPEAKER_02: like, oh, I worry, she's not ready for a child. SPEAKER_02: I've waited a lot, she is an adult, SPEAKER_02: it is her life. SPEAKER_02: You can be there as a friend, SPEAKER_02: but Unknown: just SPEAKER_02: be careful, SPEAKER_02: you're not also like burning yourself out. SPEAKER_01: Yes. SPEAKER_02: I think there is a delicate way SPEAKER_02: you can go about this, I do. Unknown: Okay. Unknown: I SPEAKER_02: hope that helps, good luck. Unknown: And SPEAKER_02: we'll Unknown: probably SPEAKER_02: do, if I least like, Unknown: I SPEAKER_02: don't know, like another week of Unknown: podcast. SPEAKER_02: At least. SPEAKER_02: Two weeks. SPEAKER_01: At least two weeks. SPEAKER_01: I'm in town for two weeks. SPEAKER_01: Oh, I think that's the end of the episode. SPEAKER_01: Love you guys, we'll see you on the Patreon. SPEAKER_01: If you haven't checked it out, we talk mad shit there. SPEAKER_01: Like mad, crazy shit. SPEAKER_01: It's like the podcast, but unfiltered. SPEAKER_01: Let's talk about gun ownership in America. SPEAKER_01: Wait, can we give my teaser? SPEAKER_01: What are we doing today on the Patreon? SPEAKER_00: Today we have a couple activities that we can do. SPEAKER_00: We've got activities, so much room for that. SPEAKER_02: So no gun ownership talk Unknown: on SPEAKER_02: the Patreon. SPEAKER_02: You know SPEAKER_01: what, we'll talk about gun ownership on the Patreon. SPEAKER_01: We'll see you there. SPEAKER_01: Bye. SPEAKER_01: So gun ownership. SPEAKER_01: Actually, I was going to say, SPEAKER_01: oh, SPEAKER_02: it's time to become an alt-right grifter Pokemon. SPEAKER_02: What if the podcast blew up TEDx? SPEAKER_02: So Pomeranian at the top. SPEAKER_02: You're going to be with Discord Daddy? SPEAKER_01: Or are you more of the Daddy that I could be a kitten too? SPEAKER_01: Ooh, who should be the Daddy here?",
