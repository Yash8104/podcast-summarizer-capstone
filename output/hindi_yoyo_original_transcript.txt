I was on a world tour with Shah Rukh Bhai. I was in America.
I came back from there.
I was running a big show on Star Plus.
Raw Star.
I designed everything.
It took me 1.5 years.
From setup to everything.
Cast crew.
I mean, everything I designed in 1.5 years.
When it was happening, I thought, I am not able to do this.
I was getting wrong thoughts.
I was getting psychotic symptoms.
What were you thinking?
In 60 seconds, there were 60 thoughts.
And 60 different divisions.
Now I am touring India.
I am touring India.
I have been to Chennai.
They are singing Punjabi songs.
I told them there.
I said, I will say this.
I said this in Hyderabad.
I said, we go to Europe.
German will not speak French.
French will not speak German.
Both see each other for a day.
But today, you are standing in South India.
You are not a girl.
You are singing in brown.
I said, if India is one, then what can we do?
Welcome to TRS, friends.
Friends, in today's edgy, intense conversation,
we will be accompanied by Yoyo Honey Singh.
I promise you, a lot of his interviews have come online.
But a podcast like this, which is so dark,
you will only get on TRS.
Not only dark, but also deep.
Spiritual talks have also happened.
Because this is TRS, friends.
This look, this is styled by Agio.
If you also want such styling, such fashion,
then download Agio app today
and style yourself immediately.
Today, Honey Singh will teach us
how to achieve it in style
and how to think in style.
The more depth they have,
I think very few people know about that depth.
And today we will get to know their reality through TRS.
This is Yoyo Honey Singh on TRS.
Yoyo Honey Singh
Yoyo Honey Singh
How are you, brother?
Very good, brother.
It feels so good that you are sitting in front of me.
Thanks, brother. Thank you so much.
I am feeling that the college me is dreaming right now.
Oh wow!
How are you, brother?
Very good, brother.
Okay.
You have such a friendly vibe.
I am just your friend. I am your elder brother.
100%.
From where you have come out, I have also come out from there.
Okay.
So those are the streets.
Those are the roads.
Those are the destinations.
What is the destination?
Death.
Death will happen.
But before that, we will reach the peak.
Okay.
Death will happen.
Okay.
But till then, we will do something
which people have not seen before.
Break down the peak a little bit.
There is a lot to be done.
First of all, we have to do something that has not been done.
Mount Everest cannot climb.
But the one who did it for the first time, his name was named.
So, what is his name?
Neil Armstrong.
He cannot be made.
But he was made. His name was also named.
So something that has not been done before.
Okay.
It is just the beginning.
There was a lot of break in the middle.
But maybe it is because
the more you have to throw the arrow, the more you have to pull it back.
Hmm.
So pull it back.
The one who stayed for 7 years,
he has put the arrow more and made it stronger.
So if it goes, it will go for a long time.
Believe in God.
A lot.
So why did God pull that arrow back?
Because then he stopped believing in God.
Okay.
In 2012, when I got success,
before that, I used to believe in God.
It was medium.
It was not a hardcore belief.
But yes, I used to thank God.
And I used to ask for a lot.
I got it.
When I got it,
I felt that
I am God.
2012, 2013, 2014.
I saw so much.
So much money, so much success, so much everything.
I stopped believing in God.
Okay.
After that, God made me understand
that I am God.
You are not.
Then I slowly came back to that side.
How belief in God decreases or decreases?
Because of friends?
No, no, no.
It has gone inside on its own.
It is your life experiences on its own.
Okay.
And because of your circumstances.
And when I was taught since childhood,
I used to play tabla in Kirtan.
I was very devotional.
I was taught in six schools in Delhi.
So there was a Divinity subject.
Which was taught till 8th standard.
So in that,
Japji Sahib, our holy book,
used to be recited.
So I used to believe in that.
I used to read a lot.
In childhood,
there was a lot of Kirtan at home.
There was an atmosphere of Shabad Kirtan.
And everything was there.
But when I became young,
when I became young,
some desires arose.
And those desires were not being fulfilled.
So a little belief in God decreased.
I saw my father.
That father works so hard.
But he doesn't leave belief in God.
So I will also hold that belief.
Rest is all about hard work.
Which I learnt from him.
That hard work is very important.
So my father worked hard for six days.
He used to take us to Gurdwara on the seventh Sunday.
So that belief remained in my touch.
Then after that,
when I became young,
there was more focus in life.
Career, passion,
doing this and that.
So I moved away from God a little.
And when
after working so hard,
when I got something,
I felt that I have done it.
No one has done this.
God has not done this.
Prayers have not done this.
I have done this.
I was like that.
A lot.
A lot.
And when I came out of the illness,
when I came out of it,
from 2021,
then belief started that
yes, no,
there is a supreme power.
But how did that belief enter your life again?
How did it re-enter?
Did something happen?
I don't know.
Gradually,
I started coming closer to God.
And
I spent a lot of time alone.
I have said this in many interviews.
I didn't come out of my house in 3.5 years.
And
in 1.5 years,
I didn't come out of my room.
And when I used to bathe,
I used to open the door and bathe.
I had so much fear inside me.
Bipolar disorder with psychotic symptoms
which was a problem.
Which is more due to dry intoxication
and drinking alcohol.
And due to lack of sleep.
And
due to wrong lifestyle.
Dry intoxication means weed.
Yes.
I used to do a lot.
I was introduced in 2012.
I have done it for 2 years.
I have done it in extreme.
Due to that,
my entire career has collapsed.
Everything.
So
the rest
I saw a lot in that darkness.
I saw God,
I saw Satan.
Both of them spread their arms.
Then
I chose God.
You know,
when I was in college,
there were rumours that
you were seen in a satanic church.
Is it true?
Yes, I went there.
In a satanic church?
In England.
What happened there?
Do you know what happened?
No.
I was in England.
I was shooting.
So
a lady who knew a friend of mine
she told me
that you have to go somewhere with me.
I said,
as you say.
Let's go after shooting.
She said,
we have to go to eat food.
It will be of your choice.
There is a restaurant in Bangkok
which is called
Halsana.
It is a Pakistani restaurant.
I like their mint chicken very much.
Which I have been eating since 2007.
I am telling you this story of 2013.
The beginning of 2013.
I was in London.
I went there.
There was an Indian restaurant.
For the first time
I am saying this in front of a camera.
Sorry, bro.
No, no.
It is true.
This is true.
So I went there.
The whole restaurant was empty.
There was a white bartender.
And
there was no waiter.
That lady sat there.
She started talking.
The order was not taken.
But the order came in front of me.
And it was the same mint chicken
which I used to eat in Bangkok.
Her face looked like that.
I said,
what is this bro?
This seems big.
After asking my friends
it seems like
something like this
has been told
that I like it.
Arrange it here.
It looks the same.
I said,
it was the same taste.
I said,
what is this?
She said,
it is nothing.
I said,
so?
She said,
shall we go upstairs?
There was a secret door.
There was a satanic church
which was empty.
There was a board outside.
I went there.
I was very excited.
Because I had stopped believing in God
since 2012.
I had not believed in the devil.
But I was very attracted to the devil.
I used to do devilish activities.
I used to do drugs.
I used to do this.
I used to do that.
I used to enjoy.
I was very attracted to that.
I was not scared of that.
I used to sit on the chairs
like a child
and take photos.
The energy there was very different.
It was very strong.
How was it?
It was very compressive.
It was very compressive.
It was very compressive.
If you clap,
there will be no reflection.
Heavy energies.
Very much.
I understood that
the work is serious.
She said,
what do you want to do in life?
I said,
whatever I want to do,
I will do.
Come to us.
We will get you everything.
Boys come there
with bigger plans.
Council sets.
They will help them.
I understood that
I don't want to do this.
But it is a good experience
for an experience.
No one knows about this.
I posted the photo on Facebook
on the internet.
It was posted in an hour.
My media...
Rajbhai used to watch it
from Canada.
He used to live in England.
He removed it.
He said,
I will have to remove it.
He removed the photo.
I was holding
his stick.
He used to sit on the chair
where the masons used to sit.
I went there.
Nothing more happened.
Nothing more happened.
Because the rumours were that
you made a deal with the devil
because of which you got success.
I got excited after that.
I got very excited.
I started researching
about the alumni culture.
I got very inclined towards it.
Are famous people
into Illuminati culture?
I don't know.
They say there is lots of speculation.
I don't know the truth.
I don't know what it is.
But there is something.
It is strong.
If you look at it
at a big level,
at the top floor,
you can see its reflection.
There must be something.
There must be some people.
You can see it.
You can see it in every way.
In India?
Worldwide.
In petroleum.
In pharmaceuticals.
In wars.
In entertainment.
In films.
In paste.
In soap.
You can see it everywhere.
If you want to see it.
Those people wanted you to...
I don't know what it was.
I didn't ask again.
I got happy.
I said that it is right.
It is good.
There is one thing.
Till then, I was defamed.
Very defamed.
Despite being defamed,
I was successful and famous.
And people were loving me.
It was a bad boy image.
At that time.
So I said that
intellectual people
intellectual
so called intellectual
You know how much hypocrisy is there in India.
So the
hypocrite intellectual Indians
who
misogyny and double meaning
and
spoiling culture
and
promoting western culture
they all abuse me.
Which doesn't make much difference to me.
That there are many people who love me.
And I am successful.
If there was no success, it would have been different.
But they are not liking me.
So they are liking me.
They have attracted me a lot.
They are loving me.
So they said come.
But I didn't go there.
Because somewhere there was a belief.
The light that God had awakened in me.
Devotion.
For God.
In the middle Guru Nanak Ji stood up.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji saved me.
I was about to die.
Death came to my house.
My mother stood up.
That phase was there.
My documentary is coming on Netflix.
This year.
In my illness and my career.
Because a lot happened against me.
A lot of statements.
A lot of protests.
A lot of court cases.
When I came out of a Punjab industry.
I was a music director.
Since 2007.
5 in fact.
So singers used to pay me.
I used to make music for them.
And write songs.
When I started singing.
So from one industry where I am coming.
They said this guy was our music director.
He will sing himself.
And the other industry where I was going.
Where I was being called.
Bollywood.
They said we have been playing here for 30 years.
I never stood with him.
I was holding him in my hand.
So.
That passage.
And.
That outburst.
From the media.
Not from the people.
People never said anything against me.
If people used to say.
I would have been hit.
Some conspiracy theorists.
Developed an image against me.
Developed a plan in the media.
I never gave any clarification.
I never gave any interviews.
Because in 5 slides.
They never said anything against me.
They never said anything against me.
And podcasts didn't exist then.
And I said there will be a time.
On one camera.
On one mic.
So Netflix came to me.
That we want to make a documentary.
Tell me in English or Hindi.
I said make it in Hindi.
I said I will ask you a question.
Why do you want to make a documentary?
They said so much happened against you.
But you never said anything.
Why didn't you say anything?
I said I will wait for this moment.
I will say now.
So I have said a lot.
It is a very interesting documentary.
Actually people will know who I am.
I am not what people saw.
God has given your soul.
Such a strange journey.
Such success.
It happened with everyone.
It happened at an extreme level.
It happened with everyone.
I am not comparing.
I am not equal.
Shri Ram had to go to Banwas.
Even after going to Banwas.
He was with Sita Ma.
And what Ravan did.
He had to fight a different war.
I am not comparing myself.
With Mahapurush.
But if you see the history.
Of the world.
For those who are different.
For those who have some blessings.
For those who have some blessings.
For those who can walk long.
For those who can walk long.
There is sea, mountains.
There is a smooth road.
When you used to weed.
Did you ever get high?
I used to get sleepy.
I used to drink.
Because my mind used to go slow.
My nerves used to beat fast.
I used to do so much.
So much was happening.
I never used to sleep.
I used to eat.
I used to drink.
I never used to sleep.
So my main problem was.
Because of sleeping disorder.
I was abused.
Because of these toxic things.
Because of its blend.
I got such a crash.
That I thought nothing will happen.
Take me home.
I was on a world tour with Shah Rukh.
I was in America.
I came back from there.
I had a big show on Star Plus.
I designed everything.
From setup to cast.
I designed everything in one and half year.
When it was happening.
I thought nothing is happening.
I was getting wrong thoughts.
Psychotic symptoms.
In 60 seconds.
There were 60 thoughts.
And 60 divisions.
Nothing is in your control.
What was the darkest thought?
That I will also die.
I will sit on this show.
I will also die.
Because of these things.
Drug abuse, alcohol abuse.
As in weed abuse.
You became a sort of introvert.
Complete introvert.
You stayed at home.
I didn't become an introvert.
I became a patient.
You became a patient.
You became an introvert.
You stayed at home.
I became a patient.
I didn't understand my family.
Doctors took 3.5 years to understand my case.
Even after that.
7 doctors in the world were unsuccessful.
I met a doctor in 2021.
Dr. Rahul Marada.
The thing is.
In our psychiatric science.
There are many big names.
They treated me.
But this is nonsense.
They don't understand how to handle this.
My case was also very severe.
One doctor said.
Albert Einstein has this stage.
This is the stage.
No one used to talk to me.
I didn't understand.
Your career started as a music composer.
Yes.
Did you hear tunes in this stage?
No.
I didn't know music.
Music was gone.
I am sure.
You believe that music is also a gift from God.
Yes.
We have a frequency.
On which every keyboard is tuned.
It is 440.
440 is a sound tuning.
Science tells.
I didn't listen to anyone.
I was a very wise person.
In my childhood.
Even in my youth.
I was struggling in Punjab.
They explained to me.
What is 440?
What is 440?
It is the frequency of sound.
That is set by God.
How did God set it?
He said.
Do you know what sound it is?
It is the sound of a stick spinning.
I asked.
What is the sound?
It is the sound of earth spinning.
The sound of earth.
The frequency of 440.
That is related to music.
It is a natural.
Super natural frequency.
Which you connect.
Higher dimension.
Both are high dimension.
Music also comes from that dimension.
Especially the music that becomes successful.
It is not like that.
Every music.
You also have music in you.
Ask why.
Because you are talking to me in pitch.
You said every music.
This is detuned.
You are in tune.
Your musical.
Because you are divine and connected on 440.
Resetted on 440.
This is you.
Your musical.
Not every person is silent.
Every person is in tune.
Have you seen any person walk like this?
Either fast or slow.
But in rhythm.
So rhythm is in every person.
Sound is in every person.
How are you now?
I am much better now.
Since 2021.
Since my medication has changed.
There are some changes in my life.
Doctor has changed.
Magician.
What changes?
Personal changes.
Changes in personal life.
Habits?
No.
Okay.
This is our RGO presents.
Super casual round.
Ask me some questions.
I will ask some tangential questions.
So that as a podcaster.
I know more about your heart.
Are you ready honey?
Yes.
One misconception people have about.
Yoyo Honey Singh.
That I am Yoyo Honey Singh.
Okay.
What is there in Hirdesh's personality.
That is not in Yoyo Honey Singh's personality.
Simple.
Okay.
Okay.
Is Hirdesh.
A good guy trying to be bad.
Or a bad guy trying to be good.
He is a very bad guy.
Trying to be good.
No. Not trying anything.
Not trying anything.
I never tried to be something.
I never ever tried to be Yoyo Honey Singh.
I wanted it.
Two different things.
Trying to be and wanted.
I am not trying to be anybody.
I am just a bad boy.
You think you are a bad guy?
Very bad guy.
If clothes are an offshoot of your personality.
Offshoot means?
Means a representation of your personality.
The personality inside.
The outside world sees through your clothes.
Okay.
If clothes are an offshoot of your personality.
According to this.
What is Yoyo Honey Singh's favorite outfit?
Full of diamonds.
Shoes.
Not made yet.
Top to bottom.
Okay. Cool.
What is your favorite pair of shoes?
And why?
Out of all the shoes you have ever owned.
Up till childhood.
Punjabi shoes.
Khussa.
Golden thread.
Not real gold.
Definitely I will get a real gold one day.
I like Khussa a lot.
I used to wear it in Mumbai.
My Rajasthani friends used to wear it.
They used to call it Mojdi.
They call it Mojdi.
I like that a lot.
What do you think after hearing these words?
Money.
Everything.
Songs.
Life.
Sex.
Oh man I love it.
Weed.
Me.
Success.
Disloyalty.
Humility.
Humility means?
Humility.
Down to earth.
Okay. Medium.
Okay.
Bollywood.
Bollywood.
Maya Nagari.
Maya Nagari.
Illusion.
Share one truth
and one lie.
One truth and one lie.
About God.
About God.
Lies.
First the truth about God.
That he is everywhere.
And
Lies.
I don't know if it can be controversial.
That God is
in Mandir, Gurudwara,
Church and Masjid.
This is a lie.
Basically
you are trying to say that God is everywhere.
Not just one place.
Even in Satanic Church.
God is not there.
Except
that place.
Really?
That is a different place.
I didn't feel that earth.
Okay.
Honey Singh's favourite perfume and why?
Tobacco.
Okay.
Christian Dior.
Because it is a little bold.
Yes it is bold and a little
woody and tobacco.
No but psychologically why?
Warm.
Okay.
Like European perfumes
they are very cool.
They are very warm.
And they keep you very warm.
Okay.
You feel comfort from inside.
Not comfort but warmth.
You get warmth from it.
Even girls like it.
Cool.
Okay.
What is lacking in these things?
Mumbai.
Mumbai?
What is lacking in Mumbai?
Nothing. Everything is good.
Punjab.
Now
let's talk about today.
Punjab was not there when I was living there.
In your heart?
Peace.
There is no peace. Not even now.
In success?
Something is lacking.
If
in success
something is lacking that
it is good
I accept it.
According to me it is okay. But for someone else
my younger brother like you
my younger brother
he is doing this work. Podcasting.
Doing everything in media.
I want my brother to be successful.
Do you know one thing?
He will break you a lot.
He will make you cry a lot.
He will show you many failures.
So if I see from the point of view of younger brother
it is lacking.
But if I see from my side, it is good.
And success.
Don't blame yourself.
My sister lives in Australia.
She wants to do a job there.
So I think
everything is good for him.
The difficulties I had to face
I will face.
You are talking too deep.
Anyway, next.
I am right.
I am loving doing this podcast with you.
Thank you. Same here brother.
It is something new.
What is lacking in love?
There is no lack in love.
Love is complete.
Should I tell you about that too?
About mother.
Maybe if I ask you
what is lacking in romance?
Maybe mother's love.
This is also a thing.
We will use this Bollywood movie too.
We will claim it.
What is lacking in modern Indian music?
There is no lack.
That is why it is modern.
If you can teach your children
just one human value in your life
then what will be the human value?
Respecting your parents.
Strangest habit of Honey Singh.
Tell me something weird.
I am a very weird person.
Those who live with me
I am a very difficult person.
To live with.
Very much.
I am very unsuccessful in love.
I wrote a poem yesterday.
Your platform is very good.
I wrote a poem yesterday.
May there be victory everywhere.
May there be victory everywhere.
Everything is out in the world.
Money.
Everything is coming back.
May there be victory everywhere.
There will be defeat.
Have courage.
Love.
Your life will be great.
I am unsuccessful in love.
Because of me.
I am very difficult.
Very difficult person to live with.
No one can live with me.
The same.
Uparan has given everything but not love.
He has given a lot of love.
He has given a lot of romance.
He has not given love.
There is no other word for love.
Do you want to get married?
I had already got married once.
I got separated from my wife.
I won't do it again.
But my parents are telling me to do it.
But you are a lover.
I am a lover.
Every Punjabi boy is a lover.
In some very core level.
In some very core level.
If you meet Hirdesh of 22 years.
What will you tell him?
He knows everything.
He knows.
Hirdesh of 22 years knows everything.
He won an award.
Best Sound Engineering.
He had a song.
Khadke Kalaasi Tere Naate.
In 2005.
He knows everything.
If Hirdesh.
The current Hirdesh.
Becomes the PM of the country for one year.
What change will he bring?
What change will he bring?
In our country.
Somehow secularism will come back.
In a stronger way.
Anything else?
Because our Maharaj Ranjit Singh.
Of Punjab.
Who ran the Sikh Empire for a long time.
People know very little.
People think that it was the Sikh Empire.
If it was the Empire.
The majority of Sikhs.
Sikhs were only 18% at his rule.
They were secular people of multiple cultures.
Every temple, religion.
Gurudwara.
Girija Ghar.
Masjids were made in Punjab at that time.
Not even in Punjab.
They had a very big providence.
I will try to do something similar.
You can do it with your music.
They do it.
When I was touring India.
I went to Chennai.
They were singing a Punjabi song.
I told them.
I said this in Hyderabad.
I said we go to Europe.
German will not speak French.
French will not speak German.
Both see each other.
But today you are singing in South India.
You are not a girl.
If we are one.
What can we do?
Complete the following sentences.
The biggest fear is?
Death.
Honey Singh looks sexiest in?
As in?
In what?
In suits.
Pain is dash.
Pain is pleasure.
Pleasure.
Rap is dash.
Rap is
nonsense.
What is the full form of rap?
Javed Jafri made it.
Don't worry.
I will say what you are worried about.
For me.
Javed Jafri has heard.
He said in his interview.
Rap means.
Don't worry.
Rap is nonsense.
5 Indian musicians.
A R Rahman.
Apache Indian Sir.
Amar Singh Chamkeela.
Kuldeep Manak.
And.
Sevamani.
To improve the modern rap scenario.
4 tips.
According to Honey Singh.
This is something different.
This is happening now.
There is a lot of debate on this.
It will be a long chapter.
Because I.
Started making beats from 2003.
The boys who used to rap in English.
Were from Goa.
They used to rap in English.
I started making beats for them.
In 2003-04.
Before that.
I was a music journalist of hip hop.
I used to listen to hip hop as a journalist.
I used to open the layer of each beat.
What is played.
What is the tempo.
I didn't have the sense of music.
I was a music journalist.
I wanted to make these beats.
I want to do this.
So as a music producer.
Singer, rapper, writer.
If you ask Honey Singh.
About the rap that is happening now.
I can't say anything.
Because I am a struggling artist.
But as a music journalist.
If you ask me about hip hop.
It will be a big chapter.
It will be a podcast.
Your least favorite abuse.
Least favorite abuse.
My mom used to tell me.
Don't abuse in a podcast.
Least favorite is this dog.
The basic abuse.
It will be average.
But that least favorite.
It is close to every Indian's heart.
Action is different.
My mom will scold me.
She will see.
She will say.
Okay.
Last question of this round.
Keep it casual.
Honey Singh.
Favorite thing about yourself.
Favorite thing about myself.
That I am very.
Very romantic.
Very very.
And from that romance.
Songs come out.
I am romantic about everything.
I am romantic about every situation.
I am not doing romance.
I am doing romance with my lover.
I am doing romance with my life.
I am doing romance with God.
He teases me.
I tease him.
He says something to me.
I say something to him.
He asks me something.
I ask him something.
What does God ask you?
Honesty.
I have honesty.
Love me with honesty.
I cheat and love.
It fades out.
But now it is very strong.
From 2021 till now it is very strong.
I am a devotee of Bhole Baba.
I believe in Guru Gobind Singh and Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
I believe in all religions.
But I have a connection with Bhole Baba.
Why?
I don't know.
I feel that
He
All gods
All gods and goddesses
He went through a lot.
I mean
He is very prime.
And how many other gods
worshiped him.
How many saints worshiped him.
He is a different personality.
He has a different power.
He is a destroyer.
He is not in
pleasure.
His idol is placed
on the graveyard.
There is a snake in his throat.
He is a sadhu. He is a malang.
There are not as many
preachings as
I have tried to research.
There are not as many preachings
of Bhole Baba as
you can see and concentrate.
I don't feel
that I have less knowledge.
I don't know.
There is Gita, Ramayana.
There are different Vedas.
I feel that
other gods
have more influences.
There is a lot of work of Bhole Baba.
Bhole Baba is so complete
that
you can see and concentrate.
Do you do
for music?
No, for myself.
For peace.
I have done 500 podcasts.
I have learnt a lot.
In Sanskrit, there is a word ishtadev.
It means your own personal god.
What you are saying is
basically your ishtadev.
Every soul has its own ishtadev.
Do you know how to choose?
It is based on what your soul needs
at that moment.
They say that
those who are drawn from Bhole Baba
are actually
in love with
spirituality.
If you pray to Bhole Baba
he will give you
your material gifts so that you
can move towards spirituality faster.
Do you believe?
I didn't know.
I didn't know about this.
I don't
meditate for material gifts.
I mostly meditate for
Bhole Baba's power and peace.
Love is also a material gift.
Love is also a material gift.
There is no
emotion.
You are getting pleasure.
Spiritual things are beyond that.
Yes, they are different.
They are different.
What are your future plans?
I have told you
in the beginning
that I will do
whatever I want to do.
Bhole Baba says that I have been like this since my childhood.
I do what I want to do.
I did what I wanted to do.
I didn't do what I didn't want to do.
I make a lot of plans in life.
I make 10 plans.
This happens with me.
I dream big.
I have been dreaming
bigger dreams.
If I tell you now, you might laugh.
But I will do that in 10 years.
In 12 years, in 15 years.
This person came to me.
He did it.
I make a lot of plans.
I make 10 plans.
I work on 3.
I work with so much focus that I don't see anything else.
3 goes.
Next 7 stops.
After that, the next 3 come
what I thought for next year.
They come to me.
What are you doing?
I wanted to do this next year.
Bollywood came to me.
I didn't go to Bollywood.
They came to me.

Punjab Ek Amar Singh Chamkeela Ji I have started listening.
I started listening to them lyrically and their vocal texture is very different
So when I was releasing my first songs 10 years ago
Like Brown Rung, Blue Eyes, Desi Kala Kaar
They were all western melodies
So this time I am doing something different
I am using folk texture
But the beat is hip hop
And I shot the video in Mexico
With bloody 50 girls in bikini
It's a total contrast
People will say what did this man do
What was the need to do all this
But I was seeing the same visual
That I will give this visual
And there will be different colors
And there will be too much glamour
Too much skin show
And I will present it like this
You are a very blessed person
So many ideas come from the front
Circumstances come from the front
But your soul did something
Maybe in your last birth
This is the answer to my documentary
I know what my soul did in the last 5 births
Did you do any regression therapy
No therapy
I have my own belief
I am very strong
In my documentary
I have told things on this finger
Do watch it
Definitely
What is your spirituality
What is my spirituality
What is the meaning of spirituality for you
Music and love
In the end, honey
I want to ask you one question
Tell me about the most beautiful moment
In your life
The most beautiful moment
When my sister got married
Why
Because she
When I shifted to Punjab in 2007
She was studying in college
Ok
And
I was in Punjab till 12
I was working there
I used to come home on Saturday and Sunday
Delhi
And
In 12,13,14 I became a star
I earned a lot of money
I was touring a lot
In 14 everything crashed
When I reached home, my parents
And my sister
I said I did not give them time
Now that I am back with them
And after that
It was not getting better
But I used to tell everyone
Get her married
When you get better
Then I will go
So
I still remember when she got married
I was not ok
I used to get symptoms
But it was a dream of mine
That my sister got married
Which ruined my youth
For me
I waited
For a lover
For a brother
That this will be ok
So that was a beautiful moment
I want to tell you that
A movie should be made in life
Will it be made by Martin Scorsky or Ridley Scott
And in English
I used to know you as a musician
I used to know you as a media personality
I am very happy to know you as a human
To be honest
This is not exactly a podcast
Because
Podcasts are very stretched out
I want to know about you
But I understand that you have a documentary
After that documentary
We will sit after that
We will do a podcast
During that documentary
Ok
I am happy to
But
You have seen a lot in your life
And I pray to Bholenath
That this is just your beginning
And I am sure you feel that yourself
I got 30%
There is 70% left
70%
I wish you all the luck
I will let you go
From our team
We have a gift for you
I hurt my hand
I can't give it to you myself
This is on behalf of team TRS and team NGO
This is not just material gifts
I know even you don't like accepting gifts
I am the same type
I feel very strange
But just accept that it is brother's love
We will keep it in the studio
Will you come to Delhi with me
Without a camera
We have a lot to talk
We will see
I will show you
I will make you feel something
Because they can't make everyone feel
They can make everyone feel what they can
I understand
It was very nice to talk to you
I wish you all the luck
Thank you brother
God bless you
