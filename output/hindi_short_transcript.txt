SPEAKER_01: There was such a good balance
SPEAKER_01: When I reached this relationship
Unknown: I realized that this is healthy
SPEAKER_01: Applause comes from both hands
SPEAKER_01: Love should be in both places
SPEAKER_01: Respect should be in both places
SPEAKER_00: Love is friendship
SPEAKER_00: If there is no friendship, there is nothing
SPEAKER_01: Love can fade away after so many years
SPEAKER_01: But friendship is something that will always be there

SPEAKER_01: There was just a click
SPEAKER_01: That I already know this person
SPEAKER_01: It was very weird
SPEAKER_01: Because I didn't feel like this for anyone
SPEAKER_00: Has he molded himself a bit
SPEAKER_00: To be better as a partner for you?
SPEAKER_01: No, I think the beauty of it is that
Unknown: He lets me be and I let him be
SPEAKER_01: Even if we have had our differences
SPEAKER_01: We have worked our way around it
SPEAKER_01: So that he can be exactly the way he is
SPEAKER_01: What was your type?
SPEAKER_01: My type was serious
SPEAKER_01: Brutal, mature, quiet
SPEAKER_01: Because I know how long you have to be away
SPEAKER_01: I just didn't want to be with someone
Unknown: Who I had to deal with that for
SPEAKER_00: Being an actor's partner is difficult
SPEAKER_01: Yes, it is

SPEAKER_00: My husband should be with me
SPEAKER_01: It is a very comfortable space
SPEAKER_01: Zaheer is predominantly a real estate developer
