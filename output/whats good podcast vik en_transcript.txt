randolph: Yo what's up guys and welcome back to the What's Good podcast. Today we have a phenomenal guest.
randolph: The man who we've been trying to get for years, Vikkstar!
randolph: One, two, three!
simon: Thanks for this.
vikstar: I'm just going to be colourful for the
randolph: rest of
vikstar: the
randolph: podcast.
randolph: I aimed over this one, that was Nick.
randolph: Also we've got a Henry Hoover and they're not really good.
randolph: This won't collect this one.
randolph: I
vikstar: was going to say, yeah.
vikstar: We
randolph: need a Dyson.
vikstar: Yeah you do.
simon: That's a great start.
vikstar: I have one of the robot vacuum cleaners.
vikstar: Dead, dead.
vikstar: It's sick.
vikstar: He just goes on patrol.
vikstar: It's scheduled so whenever we go to bed he just goes,
vikstar: starts the vacuum and comes down.
vikstar: Is it noisy? Can you
randolph: hear it from a distance?
vikstar: It's not that noisy.
vikstar: No.
vikstar: If you close the doors upstairs you don't hear them.
randolph: Yeah, you've got one in your hair, I'll just let you
Unknown: know.
randolph: I don't know if I should say I
vikstar: don't.
vikstar: Is it right, is it public you have a dog?
vikstar: Can I say that?
vikstar: Almost.
vikstar: Oh okay.
vikstar: But I was going to ask, when you get
randolph: the dog and the dog shit that comes with dogs,
randolph: your robot might have a problem.
randolph: The one thing I've heard is dog shit clashes with
Unknown: it.
randolph: Okay, I'll keep that in mind.
randolph: Well I was looking on the internet for smart home stuff and I read it.
simon: Can
randolph: you get a bigger
simon: one?
simon: Can you get a bigger robot vacuum and it would clean up poo?
vikstar: You could probably build a poo robot that would just like take poo.
randolph: That one goes first and then that one goes out.
randolph: But to be fair, if the dog shits I'm pretty sure you'll notice.
vikstar: That's what I also think.
vikstar: Pick it up and then.
vikstar: What
randolph: if it does
simon: it in a corner?
randolph: But then to be fair.
vikstar: That's what happens.
randolph: I've seen that happen.
randolph: I think you can get something that detects
Unknown: shit.
randolph: Anyway, it's a weird start.
randolph: We've waited so long to get Vic on to talk about dog shit.
randolph: But welcome on.
randolph: Obviously, it's been a running joke on here that we tried to get you on for so long.
vikstar: I only got asked once.
simon: Yeah, we got scared off of
Unknown: that.
randolph: We only got asked once.
randolph: We always talk shit about you on here.
randolph: We're always like, yeah, fucking Vic, turn us down man.
randolph: But no, because we were like, it was our 123rd episode.
randolph: So we were like, oh, bro, Vic, come on.
randolph: And you're like, no.
vikstar: I'm like, oh, no.
vikstar: I've been on sidecast about three times the past month.
vikstar: And I was like, I just sit there with nothing new to say.
vikstar: That's me every week on here.
vikstar: I do
simon: sidecast in the day and then I do this straight afters.
vikstar: That's impressive.
vikstar: Please talk.
simon: That's
randolph: the skill.
randolph: The topics are the same as well because it's just YouTube shit.
randolph: Dream's facetiming like five times just to talk about it.
randolph: They're just going to react to it as well.
randolph: What the fuck?
randolph: You look so different.
randolph: The content machine.
randolph: Yes, true, true.
randolph: But you've been away.
randolph: Yes.
randolph: That's why you've not been on sidecast much.
vikstar: I
randolph: haven't, yeah.
randolph: So you've been free to come on here.
randolph: I took
vikstar: my annual leave.
vikstar: Yeah, sabbaticals.
vikstar: I saw Ethan was having a child and I was like, you know what?
vikstar: There's
Unknown: a
vikstar: Singapore Grand Prix.
vikstar: True.
vikstar: And if I just fly the wrong way home,
randolph: I end up in Australia.
randolph: Yeah, that's actually sick.
randolph: That works.
randolph: Is it the wrong way?
vikstar: Well, I mean, you get to Singapore, you either fly back or you fly further.
vikstar: I don't
randolph: know where Singapore is.
Unknown: A
vikstar: lot of people don't, actually.
randolph: Yeah, yeah.
Unknown: Near
randolph: Thailand.
vikstar: Yeah, Malaysia.
vikstar: Oh, I do know where that is.
vikstar: I know
randolph: where that is, yeah.
randolph: But people always get confused with the map, right?
randolph: Because it's not true.
randolph: And the map's not true.
simon: Like true sizes.
randolph: Like, sorry.
randolph: People always say zoom all the way out.
randolph: Oh, it's distorted, yeah.
randolph: They always say why don't you just fly from Japan to the US?
randolph: Because
Unknown: it's
randolph: like, it doesn't work like that.
randolph: It's about, you
Unknown: know,
simon: that ocean is actually like half the world.
simon: Yeah,
vikstar: true.
vikstar: They just couldn't make it look bad.
vikstar: Do you know what I like?
vikstar: When you zoom out on your phone, when you zoom out of the map on an iPhone,
vikstar: it shows it as a sphere and you
Unknown: can like
vikstar: zoom around.
Unknown: Yeah,
vikstar: that's class.
vikstar: So
simon: where did you go for your holiday?
vikstar: Singapore, the Grand Prix, which
Unknown: was
vikstar: very, very cool.
vikstar: It was a very sick race.
vikstar: Bit exciting.
vikstar: And it was a good excuse to go and visit Singapore.
Unknown: And
vikstar: then caught up with a load of the gang.
vikstar: My international squad fan
Unknown: came
vikstar: through.
vikstar: And then we, a load of us carried on across to Australia.
vikstar: As you can see, we went to Brisbane,
vikstar: hang out with Lachie, meet some kangaroos.
vikstar: They're legendary.
vikstar: They're so cute.
vikstar: Like you would
Unknown: think
vikstar: something that big wouldn't be just,
vikstar: look how friendly and sure they are.
vikstar: Yeah, someone jacked them, aren't they?
vikstar: You would expect them to be like rabid, but no.
simon: If you panned the camera there and it just punched Rob in the head,
simon: it would have been so funny.
vikstar: There was actually one kangaroo,
vikstar: there was a lady feeding the kangaroos and she ran out of feed,
vikstar: so she started walking away and it ran up to her and pushed her.
vikstar: They're quite cheeky.
randolph: They love their feed.
randolph: Isn't there a video of one of them that is in,
randolph: someone's in an AVV or their house or something,
randolph: and one's knocking on the window with his nails?
randolph: That's terrifying.
randolph: Go on YouTube and type in kangaroo knocking on the window.
randolph: It's mad.
randolph: This is the
simon: proper life.
simon: Bro, honestly, we won't
randolph: get the sound on here,
randolph: but literally his claws are fucking massive.
randolph: It's actually ridiculous.
vikstar: Do they use their claws though?
vikstar: I'd like to see a kangaroo.
vikstar: Bro.
simon: Good evening.
vikstar: And that's bigger than your ones?
vikstar: Yeah.
vikstar: Ours might have been wallabies, I don't know.
vikstar: Mine got jacked.
simon: I don't like that.
vikstar: It kind of looks like a minotaur.
randolph: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
randolph: Half man, half...
randolph: Half man, half
Unknown: like...
randolph: Horse or some shit.
simon: I don't like them.
simon: No.
vikstar: Singapore.
vikstar: You
randolph: made
simon: them look cute.
vikstar: I think we might have...
vikstar: I don't know if they were wallabies or kangaroos.
vikstar: Wallabies are like smaller kangaroos.
randolph: Yeah, but I think they were like decent size still,
randolph: just not like my man, kangaroo jack.
randolph: They weren't jacked.
randolph: They weren't
vikstar: on the juice.
vikstar: We saw one kangaroo that looked like he was on the juice.
randolph: He was just built in the back.
randolph: So you say he went away to kind of like match Ethan Vian off as well,
randolph: but then didn't some shoots get cancelled?
randolph: So you missed them?
randolph: Yeah, so
vikstar: it did work out that basically
vikstar: the kind of the Sidemen rule is
Unknown: you
vikstar: book in where in advance
Unknown: and
vikstar: then we'll fit shoots around it.
randolph: And
Unknown: it
vikstar: worked out fine.
vikstar: But then, yeah, there
Unknown: was
vikstar: a hide-and
Unknown: -seek.
vikstar: It was the Royal Albert Hall hide-and-seek
vikstar: that we were trying to get earlier,
vikstar: but the only date they could do was while I was away.
vikstar: So we'll move it.
vikstar: To be fair, that looked like a lot of fun.
vikstar: That was one where I watched it back and I was like,
vikstar: I've missed out on the part of that one.
vikstar: You know, it doesn't
randolph: like...
randolph: It actually looks better than it sounds, if you know what I'm saying.
randolph: I heard you guys talking about it.
randolph: I was like, that's kind of cool.
randolph: When I was watching you guys, I was like, actually, that's fucking sick.
vikstar: Yeah, because there's a lot of places
vikstar: that you think would be good for a hide-and
Unknown: -seek,
vikstar: but actually aren't.
vikstar: They need stuff to do.
vikstar: I'm trying to think what one of
Unknown: them...
vikstar: I can't think off the top of my head,
vikstar: but there are a few places that sound like they should be cool,
vikstar: and sometimes we get big mansions or castles,
vikstar: but if there's nothing in them...
vikstar: What about the castle
simon: that we did in?
simon: It was literally just...
simon: It was a big house.
simon: The outside looked slightly castle-y.
randolph: Yeah, the school one was fun.
randolph: That was really good,
simon: actually.
randolph: That was really lost.
randolph: I got really lost at school.
randolph: I'm surprised
vikstar: that video actually ever ended.
randolph: Yeah, true.
randolph: I got back and everyone was just chilling.
randolph: I'm like, wait, how long has it ended?
simon: My mic must have been on for another half an hour.
simon: Well, the weird thing
Unknown: was
simon: the hide-and-seek
Unknown: at
simon: Royal Albert Hall was your video.
randolph: Yes.
randolph: That's a joke.
simon: And that wasn't there.
simon: So he's literally texting me and like,
simon: I'll do this, get this thumbnail, do this, this.
simon: But he's not there.
simon: It was a weird...
simon: It was almost like we had a director for a
Unknown: day.
vikstar: Yeah, I was just on my phone just like, I hope this works.
randolph: Can you remember, we were on a podcast and I was going to text Vic Astley or something,
randolph: but I checked the time zones and he was going to be in bed.
randolph: Can you remember what it was?
randolph: No.
randolph: Okay, never mind.
vikstar: You should have text me anyway because time zones, we were all over the time zones.
Unknown: We
vikstar: were out till 6, 7am.
vikstar: Oh, so you
randolph: might have been just
vikstar: in
randolph: our time zone still.
vikstar: We were napping in the evenings.
vikstar: Do
randolph: you get jet lagged usually?
vikstar: Yeah.
randolph: Because Australia is obviously almost guaranteed, right?
randolph: Yeah, you
vikstar: can't not get jet lagged.
vikstar: Geez, where have we got Jake Jakey on the gram from?
vikstar: That was sick, by the
Unknown: way.
vikstar: It was just like fire past this.
vikstar: They did a $5,000 beer pong tournament at Lachlan's Team Power Party.
simon: Yeah.
vikstar: And it was good because it was just...
vikstar: Everyone gets a raffle ticket.
vikstar: Eight people are randomly drawn to play
Unknown: in
vikstar: the tournament
vikstar: and then there's semifinals and a final.
Unknown: But
vikstar: because there's money on the line, everyone actually wants to watch.
vikstar: If there's beer pong, unless there's something on the line, people won't watch.
vikstar: So yeah, all 100 people all around.
vikstar: We made it to the finals.
vikstar: It was very intense.
vikstar: I think it will be in Lachlan's video at some point.
vikstar: But it was just good hype.
vikstar: Fumbled it.
vikstar: Nearly, it was like...
vikstar: Could have gone either way.
vikstar: Yeah, there you go.
vikstar: Holy crap, that was sick.
vikstar: There you had the middle lit up.
vikstar: But I was thinking actually,
Unknown: it's
vikstar: quite cool to have something like that at a party
vikstar: because it's something that everyone watches.
vikstar: Yeah.
vikstar: I feel like we should nab that.
vikstar: Yeah.
vikstar: For a Sidemen party.
vikstar: Get a sponsor to put up a prize.
vikstar: They sponsor put up the prize as well, so it's just
Unknown: like...
vikstar: So it was
simon: literally like...
simon: 100 people at this party.
simon: Yeah.
vikstar: And eight of them got picked.
simon: Eight people were just randomly...
simon: Yeah, and
vikstar: I was one of them.
vikstar: Mad.
vikstar: I was gassed when you got picked.
vikstar: I was like, there's my thumbnail.
vikstar: Yeah, true, true.
randolph: Oh yeah, he was gassed, yeah.
simon: I was gassed when you were randomly...
simon: Yeah, honestly.
randolph: It was like Harry Potter.
randolph: You know that Goblet of Fire?
randolph: That film?
randolph: Where he gets picked out with the goblet.
randolph: Yeah, I remember that.
randolph: I remember the paper
vikstar: in the bottom.
vikstar: Yeah, it wasn't supposed to
randolph: be there.
randolph: Yeah.
randolph: But you actually got slipped in.
randolph: It was wrecked.
randolph: That was mad.
randolph: Madness.
randolph: Mad thing.
randolph: Madder than that was.
randolph: He nearly died.
randolph: He didn't nearly die.
randolph: Yeah.
randolph: He was okay in the end.
randolph: Anyway, besides from Harry Potter...
randolph: So Singapore first.
randolph: Let's get through that.
randolph: So you went to the Grand Prix?
randolph: Yes.
randolph: With Lachlan or just Lachlan or anyone else?
vikstar: There was a big, big group of us.
vikstar: Elliot came out.
vikstar: Oh sick, sick.
vikstar: Rob, Lachlan, our Irish buddies.
vikstar: The Little Lizard Gaming gang.
vikstar: Tiny Turtles and Little
randolph: Lizards.
vikstar: They're the goats,
randolph: you know.
randolph: And you were chilling with
vikstar: Lando?
vikstar: We were indeed.
vikstar: Caught up with him a bit.
vikstar: Although I only ever see him at the races.
vikstar: And that race was like 38 degrees humid.
vikstar: So I never feel like I want to...
vikstar: I feel like he's just dead.
randolph: Yeah, yeah.
randolph: In those paddocks, it's super hot, right?
randolph: It was when we worked on Formula E that time.
vikstar: It
randolph: was so hot.
randolph: I'm like, how do they do this?
randolph: They didn't have to get a helmet.
randolph: And in the car.
randolph: And
vikstar: they're in fireproof seats.
vikstar: Everything helmets.
vikstar: I'm
Unknown: like,
vikstar: you're built different.
vikstar: But yeah, no.
vikstar: It was a very, very
Unknown: cool race.
randolph: And he was like, why couldn't I play in a charity match, right?
randolph: He did
vikstar: say that, yeah.
randolph: I'm like, well maybe because you're touring the world every week.
vikstar: I reckon it was probably in the middle of the F1 season.
vikstar: I feel like it always would be.
randolph: But
vikstar: I don't know, I think that would be.
vikstar: That would be huge, yeah.
vikstar: He wanted an XIX chain.
vikstar: That's sick, that's sick.
simon: Yeah.
simon: That would be so weird.
simon: I'd be like, all right, so the seven Sidemen have one.
simon: And Landa Norris.
simon: Why
Unknown: not?
simon: I mean, if he wants to buy one, we can't stop him.
simon: Look at FaZe Clan.
vikstar: True, maybe we should just start buying.
vikstar: And just give them to...
vikstar: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
simon: You're not getting one.
simon: That's who you
randolph: side-eyed
simon: me.
randolph: No, no, no.
randolph: It's a podcast.
randolph: I was looking at you.
randolph: Every time I see Toby, he's like, I'm going to get you a chamber.
randolph: I'm like, just let me know if you will.
randolph: He said
vikstar: that to me too, but I got my own.
randolph: He's like, I'm going to get you a Randolph R one.
randolph: And I'm like, if you are, let me know, because I will otherwise get one myself.
randolph: That would be
vikstar: sick, actually.
randolph: Imagine I go and get one.
randolph: He's like, oh, I had one all along.
randolph: I'm like, oh, sorry, bro.
randolph: I ruined
Unknown: it.
Unknown: I
vikstar: told Lachlan he should get a lightning bolt.
randolph: Yeah.
randolph: It's
vikstar: literally his name as well.
randolph: That's weird, by the way.
randolph: What a beast.
randolph: Really weird that his name is Power.
randolph: That's actually not.
randolph: It's not that weird.
vikstar: Yeah,
randolph: yeah.
randolph: Well, he created his company because of that.
randolph: Yeah.
randolph: If he was called Andrew Shane, he wouldn't necessarily call it Power.
randolph: Yeah, true, true, true.
randolph: But it's still a cool name.
randolph: It is a very cool name.
randolph: Should I call him Max,
Unknown: man?
randolph: He could have a kid.
randolph: Yeah, no, that's what we said.
vikstar: We said you should call your kid Max.
randolph: Yeah, or Low.
vikstar: Low Power.
vikstar: Low Power.
randolph: So Singapore was like, what, just F1 and then chill?
vikstar: F1, see the city a bit, take it in.
vikstar: There wasn't, I didn't think it was amazing.
vikstar: I felt like it's very Western.
vikstar: It's like the most Western part of the Southeast.
vikstar: Yeah.
vikstar: Was it the first
simon: time you've been there?
vikstar: Yeah.
vikstar: But it was still cool to kind of go, have done it, seen
Unknown: it.
vikstar: Yeah.
vikstar: Kicked it there for a couple of days.
vikstar: Then we went out to Marquis.
vikstar: Shut down Marquis with the boy Nick.
vikstar: He's a legend.
vikstar: That's mad.
vikstar: He's a proper legend.
vikstar: We tried to get a table for the club that night and it wasn't happening.
vikstar: No way.
vikstar: And he was like, just bring the gang through, come through.
randolph: They're like, oh, no, no tables.
randolph: You get the XX chain out.
randolph: And they're just like, oh, come backstage, man.
randolph: Oh my god.
Unknown: That's
randolph: the AAA.
randolph: Yeah, I remember that when you were saying, that's mad.
vikstar: Outrageous.
vikstar: Is
simon: there a DJ that you don't know?
vikstar: Yeah, there's lots of DJs I don't know.
vikstar: But I know a couple.
vikstar: You know Nick.
vikstar: We went to that COD event together on the jet.
vikstar: We went to one of the shows.
vikstar: I
simon: did not talk to
vikstar: him once.
vikstar: In, where was it?
vikstar: Switzerland.
vikstar: We went
simon: from Switzerland to, no, we went from Amsterdam to Switzerland.
vikstar: Was that the first private jet we ever went
Unknown: on?
simon: I think so.
vikstar: We were gassed.
vikstar: That was, bro,
simon: we got invited to this Call of Duty thing, right?
simon: So we literally got a flight to Amsterdam.
simon: And then we go straight from there.
simon: We literally land at the airport, go straight to the hangars.
simon: Get a private jet.
Unknown: Mad.
simon: From there to Switzerland, stay in this hotel and go to a show.
simon: It was a big, big
vikstar: boy jet as well.
vikstar: Yeah.
simon: And it was just like, it was like 20 of us.
vikstar: Jeez, old school mini minter.
vikstar: The sweatshirt as well, man.
vikstar: Mini minter.
vikstar: That was a big boy jet.
vikstar: That's a big jet, man.
Unknown: But
simon: we literally just got that to Switzerland.
simon: And then we go, I played like
randolph: one game of cards
vikstar: backstage before the set.
randolph: That's mad.
randolph: I always forget, like, when you go to these corporate events,
randolph: the amount of money they put into
Unknown: it
randolph: is crazy.
randolph: Yeah, you can
vikstar: burn money.
randolph: Sometimes I'm
Unknown: like,
randolph: weird.
randolph: It's such a waste of money.
randolph: It can be sometimes, yeah.
randolph: I'm trying not to say too much so they don't stop paying us.
randolph: What, is that
vikstar: fit?
vikstar: Look at that red arrow, bro.
vikstar: He's very tall.
vikstar: Oh,
randolph: no.
randolph: He's a very tall man.
randolph: Wait, she's just got a camera on her head.
randolph: Is that her job?
randolph: To walk around with a GoPro on?
randolph: Watch,
Unknown: watch.
simon: Bro, I thought you were vlogging your trousers.
simon: I didn't see the phone.
simon: Look
randolph: at
Unknown: the camera.
randolph: That's mad, that's true.
randolph: So Singapore, is that the place that's really safe?
randolph: I'm sorry, TikTok.
randolph: And the guy left his laptop there and went around the whole day
Unknown: and
randolph: came back and it was still there.
randolph: He was saying that because of cameras,
randolph: because of the penalties if you steal.
randolph: Yeah,
vikstar: it felt really, really safe.
vikstar: There were people just passed out on the side of the street
vikstar: and no-one robbed them.
randolph: Like, come out the
vikstar: club, passed out and
Unknown: yeah.
vikstar: There was one guy with his phone just in front of him.
vikstar: We went into the club, came out like four hours later,
vikstar: he's still lying there with his phone in front of him.
simon: No
vikstar: -one will take it.
simon: Four hours and no-one helped.
simon: No-one robbed him.
simon: But no-one helped.
randolph: He was not saying like, yeah, it's really safe, man.
randolph: People just passed out.
randolph: But their phones are safe.
randolph: He went to
vikstar: help.
vikstar: Yeah, man.
randolph: Is it warm there as well?
vikstar: Yes, very humid though.
vikstar: It's like, I don't, it was, do you remember this summer here?
randolph: Yes.
vikstar: It's like that, but even more humid.
vikstar: Okay, yeah, yeah.
simon: How was, so then you went to Australia
simon: and that's where everyone was?
Unknown: Kind
vikstar: of, it was, there was like 30 of us
vikstar: and it was just, you get a random combination of people.
vikstar: Everywhere you went.
vikstar: We just kind of had a group chat
vikstar: where we put everything we were doing.
randolph: And then like some
vikstar: people, and Australia is so easy.
vikstar: It's like an hour flight between everywhere.
vikstar: So people are like, oh, I'll catch you in Melbourne.
vikstar: I'll go back to Sydney for the week
vikstar: and I'll come out to like the Gold Coast, see you there.
vikstar: And then.
randolph: Man, sounds fun.
simon: It was very
vikstar: fun.
vikstar: It was, it was big chilling.
simon: How is it hanging out with like,
simon: you see, obviously you see Rob quite often
simon: and talk to him, Lachlan the same.
simon: But everyone else, like,
simon: you don't see Preston that much, for example.
simon: No,
vikstar: I haven't seen him in years and years and
simon: years.
simon: But back in the day, it
Unknown: was,
simon: you had like your group, you had the pack
simon: and you talked every
Unknown: day.
Unknown: And
simon: obviously with the Sidemen growing up,
simon: I'm like, now you don't see them,
simon: do you find it different hanging out with them all now?
vikstar: Nah, we're still boys.
vikstar: We're boys from back in the day.
simon: Is it like exactly how it was kind of thing?
simon: Back
vikstar: in the
Unknown: day.
vikstar: Genuinely, yeah.
vikstar: I feel like both groups came together in the same
Unknown: way.
vikstar: Like we all had
Unknown: a
vikstar: hundred YouTubers we'd record with
vikstar: and we were like, these group of guys, they're the boys.
randolph: We
vikstar: want to make videos with them.
vikstar: Let's make a group together
vikstar: because we enjoy making videos so much.
vikstar: So I feel like even like in 10 years time,
vikstar: like if we weren't making Sidemen videos together,
vikstar: like we'd still be like, this the boys.
vikstar: So no, it was, it was good fun.
vikstar: Yeah.
vikstar: Hanging with everyone.
vikstar: It was
Unknown: good.
Unknown: Well,
simon: yeah, we were talking,
simon: me, JJ and Toby were talking about
Unknown: like,
simon: will the Sidemen see each other
Unknown: out
simon: of YouTube time?
simon: If you know what I
Unknown: mean.
simon: Like, for example, no one's gone and seen Ethan's baby
Unknown: yet.
simon: And admittedly it's a month old.
simon: It's not really a thing.
simon: She is a month old.
simon: I would
randolph: always say it and get told to fuck off.
simon: She is a month old
simon: until they're like a year and a half or whatever.
simon: They're just kind of like a blob.
simon: True, true,
vikstar: true, true.
simon: But no one's, no one's seen her
Unknown: yet.
vikstar: Yes.
simon: Will, is it because of the amount of recording we do
simon: that no one does or is it kind of like,
simon: are we bad people?
simon: No one will until.
randolph: Are we bad people?
randolph: Maybe.
randolph: Or
simon: are we bad people?
randolph: I think that one's true.
randolph: No, no.
randolph: I think it's both, right?
randolph: Like the schedule is mad.
randolph: Cause also
Unknown: like,
randolph: it's also like,
randolph: I think it's also weird to invite yourself around
randolph: to like a baby house, right?
randolph: You can't.
vikstar: Yeah.
vikstar: Yeah.
randolph: You got to wait for the right time.
randolph: Yeah.
randolph: But also like,
randolph: yeah, if you've got a shoot on Tuesday,
randolph: you know Ethan's gonna be there.
randolph: You're not really gonna go over like,
randolph: oh, hey, let's go.
randolph: You know?
randolph: But we still try and do the troops meals now and then.
randolph: We need to, we need to.
randolph: Cause we're long overdue.
randolph: We need to link
vikstar: up for it.
vikstar: Yeah.
vikstar: But I genuinely like,
vikstar: everyone's so busy.
vikstar: Yeah.
vikstar: It's like,
Unknown: it's
vikstar: crazy, crazy, crazy.
randolph: I think when we all like,
randolph: well, when everyone slows down,
randolph: there'll be more trips that we do.
randolph: Yeah.
randolph: That's the
vikstar: thing.
vikstar: Cause yeah,
vikstar: like a lot of the guys,
vikstar: like Lannan,
vikstar: Lockie,
vikstar: Rob,
Unknown: like
vikstar: they're
Unknown: not
vikstar: doing loads and loads of content.
vikstar: So, but it's,
vikstar: we still,
vikstar: and we don't make any content together,
vikstar: but we still just hang out.
vikstar: Yeah.
vikstar: Five.
simon: Yeah.
simon: Well you,
simon: you've slowed down with content.
simon: Yes.
simon: In terms of personal stuff.
Unknown: Yes.
vikstar: How,
vikstar: like how,
simon: how is it?
vikstar: I don't want to ask you
simon: such a basic question,
Unknown: but
simon: obviously like,
simon: it's hard to do.
simon: You were doing
vikstar: four
simon: videos a day.
vikstar: Yeah.
vikstar: Four, five, six.
simon: Yeah.
vikstar: It's hard to
Unknown: do.
Unknown: but
vikstar: I enjoy it.
vikstar: No, it's,
Unknown: it's
vikstar: nice to,
vikstar: yeah.
vikstar: Chill.
randolph: No.
vikstar: Yeah.
vikstar: And just not,
vikstar: it's like,
vikstar: I always used to like,
vikstar: say it was like,
vikstar: you started stopwatch.
vikstar: When you're doing daily uploads,
vikstar: you upload a video,
vikstar: you work,
vikstar: you upload a video.
vikstar: When you've done that,
vikstar: you're like,
vikstar: there's a clock going for the next video.
vikstar: It's true,
randolph: man.
vikstar: You get caught in that cycle.
vikstar: I think it's a good cycle to have,
vikstar: but
randolph: I
vikstar: just got to a point where I was just like,
vikstar: okay,
vikstar: I want
Unknown: to
vikstar: step,
vikstar: step away from this.
vikstar: Just cause I wasn't enjoying it much.
vikstar: After like,
vikstar: Among Us and Warzone,
vikstar: there weren't any games that I enjoyed.
vikstar: So I was like,
vikstar: I'm not gonna either pretend to enjoy a game
vikstar: or sit and make content on a game I don't enjoy
vikstar: because then
Unknown: it's,
Unknown: that's
vikstar: not,
vikstar: why would anyone watch that?
vikstar: It doesn't make any sense.
vikstar: So it
Unknown: just,
randolph: yeah,
vikstar: didn't,
vikstar: didn't make sense.
vikstar: And then like,
vikstar: with the Cyber and stuff,
vikstar: we're doing a lot more nowadays.
vikstar: Yeah.
vikstar: And I really enjoy that.
vikstar: And I kind of like being able
Unknown: to
vikstar: put more time and effort into that.
vikstar: Yeah,
Unknown: yeah.
randolph: I know you should do a lot of meetings as well.
randolph: So it's not like you do just nothing, right?
randolph: You go,
randolph: you go and travel,
randolph: do like meetings and that.
vikstar: Yes, yes,
Unknown: yes.
vikstar: Yeah.
randolph: You did a stream recently though,
randolph: that like seemed to just bang,
randolph: by the way,
randolph: like on TikTok.
randolph: Like you did a,
randolph: you did a sponsored stream.
randolph: Oh yeah,
randolph: it was good of clips.
randolph: It was a very good of clips.
randolph: For
vikstar: weeks,
vikstar: I was like,
vikstar: fucking hell bro.
randolph: That's what you announced,
randolph: you were getting a dog,
simon: right?
randolph: That's what you announced,
randolph: you were getting a dog.
randolph: Dog,
randolph: he said,
randolph: I'm going to miss a few 7 Sundays.
randolph: I'm like,
simon: wow,
simon: this guy's
randolph: farming.
randolph: He's taking all my topics from the podcast.
randolph: That was good though.
randolph: You asked a question,
randolph: did I just button?
vikstar: No.
randolph: Speaking of Warzone,
randolph: Warzone 2 is around the corner.
vikstar: Yes,
vikstar: I will jump on.
vikstar: I will see how it goes,
vikstar: but from what I've seen,
vikstar: it doesn't look different enough
Unknown: to
vikstar: Warzone.
vikstar: Like we need something fresh and new,
vikstar: like the level that,
Unknown: what,
vikstar: you know,
vikstar: Fortnite was to PUBG,
vikstar: Warzone was to Fortnite,
vikstar: that new wave.
vikstar: But I feel
Unknown: like,
randolph: like Fortnite is still,
randolph: with the no build mode,
randolph: it's still like somewhat playable.
randolph: I feel like still people go on it a lot,
randolph: but I feel like,
randolph: Fortnite has continued its relevancy somewhat,
vikstar: whereas Warzone
randolph: just feels like it's empty now.
randolph: It's like a ghost town.
randolph: I know people stream it every day,
randolph: but
Unknown: like,
randolph: 50,000 people used to go there.
randolph: Yeah,
vikstar: like,
vikstar: now it's a ghost town.
randolph: Everyone's just waiting for Warzone 2.
randolph: We were also,
randolph: I remember everyone was waiting for Caldera,
randolph: the new map,
randolph: and then a week later,
randolph: everyone was pretending
randolph: they liked it.
randolph: I was like,
randolph: bro,
randolph: this is really fun.
randolph: And then like,
randolph: I just stopped playing.
simon: I went from bringing my back
simon: to dancing.
simon: I think Warzone 2 is going to be the same.
simon: Everyone's like,
simon: new Warzone.
simon: Yeah.
simon: Two weeks.
vikstar: Do you know,
vikstar: I think the biggest issue is that
vikstar: it won't reestablish a skill gap.
simon: What
vikstar: makes a game hype,
vikstar: exciting,
vikstar: and big,
vikstar: is a skill gap.
vikstar: The start of Fortnite,
vikstar: no one knew what they were doing.
vikstar: You build your little two by two,
vikstar: someone works out how to do like a wall ramp.
vikstar: Yeah.
vikstar: And it's like,
vikstar: oh,
vikstar: that's nuts.
vikstar: I'm going to learn to do that.
vikstar: And then I'm going to win the fights.
Unknown: And
vikstar: it was like that.
vikstar: And then with Warzone,
vikstar: it was like,
vikstar: oh,
vikstar: I'm going to learn these guns are good.
vikstar: Oh,
vikstar: if you slide cancel,
vikstar: you can get around faster.
vikstar: If
Unknown: you
vikstar: lean on these walls,
vikstar: you can do better.
vikstar: If you do this kind of stuff,
vikstar: if you spam UAVs,
vikstar: you're going to be able to get loads of kills.
vikstar: But when everyone knows it,
vikstar: it's not fun.
vikstar: And when everyone practices it,
vikstar: everyone gets so good.
vikstar: It's like,
vikstar: it's not as exciting.
vikstar: So I feel like Warzone 2
vikstar: is going to be mechanically very similar.
randolph: Yeah.
randolph: And also,
randolph: I feel like Warzone was like
randolph: a time and a place.
randolph: Because of lockdown
randolph: and COVID,
randolph: everyone was kind of like
randolph: nonstop playing it.
randolph: So it's more like the moment
randolph: in time that we all miss,
randolph: not necessarily the game.
randolph: The game still existed now
randolph: in Verdant.
randolph: So I don't think it still
randolph: would be what it was.
randolph: So it was Among Us.
randolph: Yeah.
simon: Like Among Us was the,
Unknown: it
simon: was the lockdown game.
simon: Yeah.
simon: Everyone enjoyed it
simon: for a little bit now.
simon: I mean,
simon: we could literally play it.
simon: We still enjoy it
simon: for the most part.
simon: I'm so glad
vikstar: we're able
vikstar: to keep it alive
vikstar: because it is such a content platform.
randolph: It is because the lobbies
randolph: are so bad though.
randolph: Like our lobby is awful
randolph: when we play.
randolph: That's why it's good.
randolph: Yeah, the
vikstar: good lobbies
vikstar: were always boring.
vikstar: Yeah.
vikstar: Like
randolph: when people got good
randolph: at the game,
randolph: it just got really boring.
randolph: Oh, I've just,
randolph: I've checked you didn't like
randolph: upload for like 2.3 seconds
randolph: instead of two.
randolph: I'm like, bro.
simon: Please.
simon: I just used to lie
simon: about that stuff.
simon: I used to go like,
simon: oh, you only did that
simon: for a second.
simon: But it actually takes
simon: like 1.5 seconds.
simon: And they go,
simon: oh, you're a little nerd.
simon: I was like,
simon: I was lying.
simon: If
randolph: you say something
randolph: with enough confidence.
randolph: I love you always get like,
randolph: if you're level,
randolph: if you're high level as well,
randolph: you get fucked.
randolph: Well, because of the mod
simon: ones we do now,
simon: Ethan got modded to
simon: like level 60 something.
simon: And I'm only level 18.
simon: Yeah.
simon: So now I can't be
simon: voted out just for level.
randolph: But I remember how long
randolph: that last one was took
randolph: to get going.
randolph: Oh, no, that's not
randolph: the mod.
randolph: Yeah.
randolph: Because I was not
randolph: in that episode,
randolph: but I was in two
randolph: of the recordings
Unknown: because
randolph: we never actually
vikstar: got it done.
vikstar: I'll tell you what,
vikstar: trying to install
vikstar: gaming mods with people
vikstar: that don't know
vikstar: how to use computers,
vikstar: people that don't know
vikstar: how to actually know.
vikstar: I'm not going to.
vikstar: I was about to say people
vikstar: who can't install windows.
vikstar: J.J. was actually all right.
vikstar: J.J. was one of the
vikstar: better ones.
vikstar: Oh, no, no.
vikstar: We'll call him out.
vikstar: Theo Baker.
simon: Theo Baker doesn't know
simon: how to use.
simon: He was like,
simon: OK, so now do I need
simon: to turn my PC on?
Unknown: And then he got hacked.
simon: As soon as he started,
simon: he actually got physically hacked
simon: and still beat me.
randolph: What the hell?
randolph: He
vikstar: still beat me
vikstar: and he was getting hacked.
vikstar: Oh, man.
vikstar: Yeah.
vikstar: There's a lot of fun stuff
vikstar: you can do in gaming
vikstar: with modded stuff,
vikstar: but just trying to set it up
vikstar: and make it work.
simon: Yeah.
simon: That's the issue.
simon: As much as I enjoy
simon: how bad our lobby is,
simon: it's almost getting to the point
simon: where it's too bad
simon: that I said, like,
simon: can we introduce a sheriff role
Unknown: where
simon: all it is is one person
Unknown: can
simon: try and kill the imposter
simon: and if they get it wrong,
simon: they die instead.
simon: That's it.
simon: Harry was like,
simon: don't really understand it.
simon: I don't want to play that.
simon: Sounds too complicated.
simon: And J.J. went,
simon: yeah, no, I don't like that.
simon: I don't understand it.
randolph: Also, our attention span,
randolph: this is such an easy role.
randolph: When we go to the other map,
randolph: everyone's attention span just dies.
randolph: Like, we played the regular map,
randolph: was it Skrulls?
randolph: The Skrulls.
randolph: The Skrulls.
randolph: Then we go to Polis.
simon: Yeah.
randolph: And everyone's like,
randolph: nah, I can't play this game anymore.
randolph: But
simon: Skrulls is so small.
simon: Yeah,
vikstar: but it's just classic, man.
vikstar: Yeah, we take the walk to Polis.
vikstar: Oh, my God.
vikstar: I actually like that a lot.
vikstar: I actually really enjoyed that.
simon: And I know as soon as we,
simon: if we play Polis again,
simon: I'm seeing that.
vikstar: I want that.
vikstar: I actually, I think,
vikstar: I think we should actually,
vikstar: I saw a lot of comments saying
vikstar: the new Sidemen house map is cool,
vikstar: but it's,
Unknown: it's
vikstar: too big.
vikstar: Yeah, yeah.
vikstar: We've done it.
vikstar: Yeah, I feel like we should
vikstar: just take the custom skins
Unknown: and
vikstar: go back.
vikstar: Or we could even get,
vikstar: we should actually,
vikstar: we should request a custom Polis.
vikstar: So it's a Polis,
vikstar: but with a Sidemen theming like that.
vikstar: Oh, okay.
vikstar: Okay, yeah.
vikstar: That would be cool.
vikstar: We should have that made just as...
simon: We need to do prox as well.
simon: Everyone is screaming for prox.
simon: I'm traumatized
vikstar: by proximity.
vikstar: It used to crash my computer.
vikstar: Oh, did
simon: it? Okay.
vikstar: It used to crash my computer.
vikstar: Oh, it did.
vikstar: I remember this shit.
vikstar: It did.
vikstar: I would keep rejoining the lobby
vikstar: like every second game and a half.
vikstar: And I'd be trying to stream
vikstar: so my whole stream would end.
vikstar: I remember this.
vikstar: That was dramatic.
vikstar: I'm traumatized by that mod.
simon: That mod is so,
simon: it's so good though.
simon: Yeah.
simon: The moment where you find JJ.
simon: Yeah, yeah.
simon: And JJ's like not like...
randolph: Oh, shit.
randolph: Oh, shit.
simon: Bro.
simon: That moment is goated.
randolph: I feel like the moment is nice
randolph: because
Unknown: like,
randolph: you know,
randolph: JJ really enjoys it as well.
randolph: You can tell when he's in it.
randolph: That's always nice to see.
randolph: It's a good game, man.
randolph: It's a very good like concept.
randolph: But it's just, yeah,
randolph: people took it too serious.
randolph: I remember we used to play with Tali
randolph: and then it got to a point
randolph: where she hated our lobby.
simon: Oh, yeah.
simon: No, she won't play with us.
simon: She likes to play like,
simon: she's like,
simon: why would you troll?
randolph: She's
simon: like,
simon: why would you not want to try and win?
randolph: That's enough for me.
randolph: We just vote someone out.
randolph: Some of them are just talking
randolph: and get voted out.
randolph: For no reason.
randolph: JJ says something.
randolph: Oh, man.
randolph: Why are you washed?
randolph: The
simon: most recent video is actually,
simon: oh, Vic talks a lot
simon: when he's in post.
simon: Yeah.
simon: Vote him out.
simon: And he's out.
simon: Was it you as well?
simon: No.
simon: That was the worst part.
vikstar: I feel like I talk a lot
vikstar: all of the time.
simon: Well, there was only three,
simon: it was only like you
simon: and two people left.
vikstar: It was me,
vikstar: Toby, Viz and Jamie.
simon: Four.
simon: Yeah, so four.
simon: And it was,
simon: I think it was Jamie.
vikstar: And Toby was like,
vikstar: Vic, what happened?
vikstar: I explained exactly what happened.
vikstar: Oh, you're talking a lot.
vikstar: I got voted out.
vikstar: I was like, why?
randolph: I remember Toby played me
randolph: with a symphony card once.
randolph: He's like,
randolph: you always say it's me,
simon: man.
randolph: You always say it's me.
randolph: He did that
vikstar: recently.
randolph: He did that recently.
randolph: And it was
Unknown: him.
Unknown: I
randolph: know, man.
randolph: Yeah.
randolph: And also, Ethan,
randolph: that's the memorable moment
randolph: where he's like,
randolph: Simon, I got you.
randolph: I got you.
randolph: Finally.
randolph: That was
vikstar: incredible.
vikstar: He was burning.
vikstar: He was burning
randolph: after that one.
randolph: He was, he was.
randolph: But obviously Warzone had the,
randolph: going back to Warzone now.
randolph: Yeah.
randolph: Yeah, the Warzone Wednesdays,
randolph: which were huge for you.
randolph: Yeah.
randolph: Are you still like the most
randolph: decorated Warzone Wednesdays?
randolph: No,
vikstar: no, no.
simon: Well, Warzone Wednesdays,
randolph: yeah.
vikstar: Oh, Warzone Wednesdays.
vikstar: Warzone Wednesdays stopped.
vikstar: Yeah.
vikstar: So he
randolph: can never lose his title.
randolph: True, true.
randolph: That was the best tournament
randolph: still, though.
randolph: It was.
randolph: Even by structure, man.
randolph: Like, yes.
randolph: Minecraft
vikstar: Monday was kind of lit,
vikstar: though.
vikstar: Minecraft Monday was good.
vikstar: Minecraft Monday was good.
vikstar: Fortnite Fridays was sick.
vikstar: And it's because I got bullied
vikstar: in Fortnite Fridays.
vikstar: When Warzone Wednesday came up,
vikstar: I was like,
vikstar: it's not a game.
vikstar: It's not a game now.
vikstar: I remember
randolph: when you played
randolph: with like,
randolph: Warzone Jukies, right?
randolph: You'd be like the,
randolph: the brains of the general,
randolph: and they just go and fucking,
randolph: like.
vikstar: Squad capital.
vikstar: Oh, the growl.
vikstar: Bro.
vikstar: What a beautiful gun.
vikstar: Bro, this is such a sick time.
vikstar: He was.
vikstar: On my flight back
vikstar: from Australia,
vikstar: I had so much time to kill,
vikstar: I was just watching some of these.
vikstar: And I was just
Unknown: like,
vikstar: aw, man, I miss it.
simon: Well, I remember,
simon: we used to watch them,
simon: like, everyone's just typing
simon: in the chat, like,
simon: Harvick's just done this, done this.
simon: And you always got
simon: brought out cookies.
vikstar: Yeah.
vikstar: They were,
vikstar: I mean,
vikstar: JJ would drop a donation in.
vikstar: For no
Unknown: reason.
Unknown: Yeah.
vikstar: They were,
vikstar: they were epic gamer moments.
vikstar: But yeah,
vikstar: it was also at the same time,
vikstar: like,
vikstar: I would wake up,
vikstar: eat.
vikstar: Yeah.
vikstar: Stream for, like,
vikstar: six hours,
vikstar: stop for an hour,
vikstar: eat again,
vikstar: go live again
vikstar: for, like, four hours,
vikstar: stop, eat again,
vikstar: go live for
vikstar: Warzone Wednesday
vikstar: for, like, five hours.
vikstar: It was,
vikstar: it was fun, but
randolph: I'll promise,
randolph: Warzone's a fucking,
randolph: like, wolf background.
vikstar: Why am I reacting
randolph: to me
vikstar: reacting?
vikstar: I don't know what's going on.
vikstar: This is the
vikstar: next level of inception.
vikstar: I'm so confused.
vikstar: What's going on?
vikstar: Oh, this is
simon: a new guys one.
simon: You know,
simon: I think you needed,
simon: like, one
Unknown: kill.
randolph: What's going on?
randolph: I was just assuming.
randolph: I think you'd
simon: already won
simon: at that point.
randolph: I don't even know.
randolph: In case you can't see Simon,
randolph: if they put it on again.
randolph: Mystery Dance.
randolph: Yeah, about,
randolph: I really do, man.
randolph: I really do.
randolph: But do you think that
randolph: Warzone Wednesday is going to come back
randolph: or any sort of tournament
Unknown: for
randolph: or just should be?
randolph: I'm
vikstar: scared.
vikstar: I'm scared.
vikstar: Like, what's,
vikstar: Battle Royales?
vikstar: We need a halo.
vikstar: We need a halo battle royale.
vikstar: Just a whole new universe,
vikstar: whole new set of skills,
vikstar: whole new weapons,
vikstar: vehicles, everything.
vikstar: That's what we need.
vikstar: We need someone to do
simon: it.
simon: Do you think the Sidemen should do
Unknown: a
simon: tournament ever?
simon: Of like,
simon: we're not in
Unknown: it.
simon: We're just,
simon: like,
simon: did you see how Warzone Wednesday
simon: was keemz, right?
vikstar: Yeah.
simon: Like that,
Unknown: but
simon: Sidemen won.
simon: The next time a game pops
Unknown: off.
vikstar: We should, yeah.
vikstar: We should do a tournament.
vikstar: Honestly, we should.
vikstar: Because, yeah,
vikstar: we could pump the viewership so much.
vikstar: You get crazy sponsors.
vikstar: It could be like
vikstar: a way bigger prize pool.
Unknown: Well,
simon: there you go.
simon: It's coming.
vikstar: We just need a game.
vikstar: What's the game?
vikstar: Where are the games, man?
vikstar: I feel like it has to be
vikstar: a battle royale game.
vikstar: It does, yeah.
vikstar: Just like,
vikstar: like competitive Overwatch,
vikstar: competitive Valorant.
vikstar: I just don't,
vikstar: I don't care when they respawn.
vikstar: It doesn't have the same build.
vikstar: Yeah, it doesn't.
vikstar: Like H1Z1,
vikstar: like PUBG,
vikstar: like when you're watching
vikstar: that person who's
Unknown: been
vikstar: sweating for 20 minutes,
vikstar: just trying to win
vikstar: every gunfight,
vikstar: every 50-50,
vikstar: they've won like
vikstar: 12 of them in a row.
vikstar: And it comes down to that.
simon: Yeah.
simon: It's
vikstar: that build is so
vikstar: entertaining.
vikstar: We need it.
simon: But,
vikstar: but it's crazy because
vikstar: it can be the same game.
vikstar: Like it could be
vikstar: literally Caldera,
Unknown: but
Unknown: people
vikstar: just
Unknown: don't
vikstar: care in the same way.
vikstar: It's weird, yeah.
vikstar: It's not as exciting.
Unknown: Yeah.
simon: Well,
simon: you were talking about like
simon: your PC breaking and stuff.
simon: That was at your flat, right?
simon: Yes.
simon: Now you're in a house.
vikstar: Same PC, I think.
vikstar: It's
simon: the same one now?
vikstar: Yeah.
simon: Okay.
simon: Well, then,
simon: prox might not happen.
simon: Well, to
vikstar: be fair,
vikstar: the mod has probably
vikstar: changed so much.
vikstar: Yeah, yeah.
vikstar: I think it's really
simon: easy now.
vikstar: We'll give it a run.
Unknown: But
simon: you're living
simon: in a house.
vikstar: I
simon: am.
simon: How is it?
simon: It's...
simon: Because he's now
simon: living in a house.
vikstar: It's nice.
vikstar: Yeah.
simon: Barely though.
simon: But he is off.
simon: Yeah, true.
simon: Oh, I thought you were
simon: making a joke
simon: how small my house
randolph: is.
randolph: No.
simon: Barely.
simon: We call it a house.
simon: You moved.
simon: Bro, I literally
simon: have
randolph: stayed maybe like
randolph: six nights in my house.
randolph: It's actually mad.
randolph: Wait,
vikstar: why?
vikstar: Are you
randolph: always
vikstar: down here?
randolph: Yeah, I've been traveling
randolph: to London.
randolph: I went away to America as well.
randolph: Are you
vikstar: overlapping your flat
vikstar: and your house
vikstar: or are you keeping both?
randolph: No, no, flat's
Unknown: gone.
vikstar: Done now.
vikstar: I
randolph: was going to,
randolph: but I got advised
randolph: by my accountants
randolph: to not do that
randolph: because...
randolph: Do hotels instead
randolph: because of business costs.
randolph: Smart, write it off.
randolph: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
simon: But he literally moved
simon: and then four days later
simon: went away for a week,
simon: came back for five days,
simon: went away for a week.
randolph: It's actually annoying
randolph: because I've got...
randolph: There's a desk over there
randolph: that I'm being set up.
randolph: This
vikstar: could be like a little...
vikstar: Yeah,
randolph: so my plan was
randolph: to have a studio here
randolph: for streaming our music.
randolph: So when I travel here,
randolph: nothing changes,
randolph: so it's just the same,
randolph: but then
Unknown: we
randolph: moved
randolph: the podcast studio as well
randolph: the same time I moved house,
randolph: so it's just been really annoying
randolph: to get everything organized
randolph: and even my house
randolph: is now still full of boxes.
randolph: We've got one of the spare rooms
randolph: that you can't even get into.
randolph: I cleared
vikstar: out
vikstar: a load of boxes today.
vikstar: I'm still going through boxes.
randolph: It'd
vikstar: be that way.
randolph: But how's it been
randolph: living in the house?
vikstar: No, it's nice.
vikstar: I really enjoy it.
vikstar: It's peaceful.
vikstar: It's
Unknown: like...
vikstar: Actually, one thing that,
vikstar: especially when I come
vikstar: into London now,
vikstar: it's so busy.
simon: Yeah.
simon: I didn't
vikstar: realize
vikstar: how much of a blessing
vikstar: it was in lockdown.
vikstar: Get across London,
vikstar: no traffic,
vikstar: walk through central London.
vikstar: What do
simon: you mean
simon: get across London?
simon: Where were you going
simon: in lockdown?
vikstar: Sidemen suits.
vikstar: We were allowed as well.
vikstar: We didn't
simon: have any,
Unknown: bro.
simon: We were not in lockdown.
simon: Not lockdown one,
simon: lockdown three.
simon: The
vikstar: one where
vikstar: we were allowed to work.
vikstar: The one where we were
vikstar: Rule of six.
vikstar: Where we went
vikstar: and did a mukbang
vikstar: and sat three meters
vikstar: away from each
Unknown: other.
randolph: I don't think one day
randolph: in lockdown one
randolph: I did go to JJ's.
vikstar: I'm telling the government
vikstar: he
randolph: can.
randolph: He just did.
randolph: It was one of those ones
randolph: where no one really
randolph: got the rules.
randolph: I didn't believe it.
randolph: I'm like,
randolph: sure you can still go out.
randolph: Then I got a cab,
randolph: and there was no one
randolph: in London at all.
randolph: I was the only guy.
randolph: I was like,
randolph: shit, maybe I should
randolph: have stayed at home.
randolph: Maybe I should have
randolph: followed the rules.
randolph: Fuck me.
randolph: It's fine,
randolph: you can leave that in.
randolph: I don't care.
vikstar: It was a very
vikstar: dystopian time.
vikstar: I remember I sat
vikstar: in a park once
vikstar: and someone came up
vikstar: and they were
Unknown: like,
vikstar: are you doing
vikstar: your hour of exercise?
vikstar: I just sat on my own
vikstar: in
simon: the park.
vikstar: I guess
simon: I'll walk
simon: in a circle.
vikstar: How crazy is that?
vikstar: A police officer asked me
vikstar: why I was just
vikstar: sat by a tree outside.
randolph: You should get one
randolph: of those hand exercises.
randolph: Just sit there
randolph: doing this.
simon: Do you ever see the one
simon: of like 20 guys
simon: just on this street
simon: and a policeman comes up
simon: and they just start
simon: going,
simon: hi niggas everyone.
simon: I've
randolph: seen that.
randolph: It was a weird time,
randolph: wasn't it?
randolph: Looking back,
randolph: it's so strange.
randolph: I remember talking to you
randolph: and JJ about it
randolph: because that was when
randolph: we would do the podcast
randolph: and record music for him
randolph: in
simon: that room.
randolph: And it was like,
randolph: 60 people
randolph: either died
randolph: or got it or something.
randolph: And then I remember
randolph: it was being like,
randolph: it's not gonna happen.
randolph: It's not gonna shut down things.
randolph: And then literally
randolph: a month later,
vikstar: gone.
vikstar: I remember I was supposed
vikstar: to go to Miami
vikstar: for Miami Ultra
vikstar: and there's all these
vikstar: headlines and like,
vikstar: surely they're
Unknown: just
vikstar: causing a scene
vikstar: and gassing it up.
vikstar: Headlines gotta be headlines.
vikstar: And then literally
vikstar: the week before,
vikstar: they were like,
vikstar: borders are
Unknown: shut.
randolph: I'm like,
randolph: it's a situation.
randolph: Especially in the UK,
randolph: not in the rest of the world.
randolph: There's never really been any
Unknown: like,
randolph: we hear about big news stories
randolph: like hurricanes,
randolph: tsunamis,
randolph: pandemics,
randolph: but never really
randolph: in the UK
randolph: never had anything wrong.
vikstar: So
randolph: like,
randolph: when you read headlines,
randolph: you still think it's fake
randolph: or like,
randolph: it's just a headline.
randolph: So you're like,
randolph: oh, COVID,
randolph: just on the news.
randolph: But private,
randolph: it was real.
randolph: It became
simon: very real, man.
simon: Well, like me, JJ,
simon: you and Josh
simon: all moved into London.
randolph: Bro, I don't know.
randolph: Scammed.
simon: Literally,
simon: you got out the house
simon: like two months earlier than us,
simon: I think.
simon: Yeah.
vikstar: So I had one winter
vikstar: sash.
simon: You were out of it.
simon: And then we move into London
simon: and it's literally like
simon: a month later,
simon: And it just became
Unknown: like
vikstar: pointless.
vikstar: I did enjoy though,
vikstar: just walking around London.
vikstar: Like I walked,
vikstar: I remember I walked all the way
vikstar: from like,
vikstar: down the River Thames,
vikstar: past houses,
vikstar: past London Eye,
vikstar: past the House of Parliament,
vikstar: back around
vikstar: down the other side of the river,
vikstar: walked home.
vikstar: And I didn't see
vikstar: one single person.
vikstar: That was the first week
vikstar: where it was like,
vikstar: stay inside,
vikstar: do not go outside.
randolph: And
vikstar: as I was walking,
vikstar: I was like,
vikstar: this will never happen again
vikstar: in my entire life.
randolph: Yeah, yeah.
randolph: I remember thinking
Unknown: that.
randolph: It got annoying as well
randolph: when everything came back
randolph: because it like ruined London.
randolph: Because it's so beautiful.
vikstar: Yeah, in a way.
vikstar: And now it's just fucking...
vikstar: It was, yeah.
vikstar: There were parts of London
vikstar: that were peaceful.
vikstar: Anywhere I go in London now,
vikstar: it's just like...
randolph: Yeah.
randolph: You keep your head down.
randolph: You keep your head down,
randolph: you don't even look at it more.
randolph: Whereas back then,
randolph: it was like perspective and stuff.
randolph: Yeah,
vikstar: we went and just looked
vikstar: at loads of old buildings.
vikstar: Like, that's all you could do.
vikstar: You would just go
vikstar: and walk and look at things.
randolph: Yeah.
randolph: I knew that was
simon: going to happen.
simon: It happens all the
Unknown: time.
randolph: I usually leave it
Unknown: in.
simon: It stops in
Unknown: like
simon: 10 seconds.
vikstar: If you were Charlie Puth,
vikstar: you'd remix this.
vikstar: C minor.
simon: And stop.
randolph: Right, this
Unknown: is
simon: going a bit long now.
simon: I'm starting to
Unknown: worry.
simon: Did that happen before?
randolph: No,
Unknown: sure.
simon: There we go.
Unknown: And...
simon: Nice.
randolph: Nice.
simon: We've had that in sidecasts before.
Unknown: Yeah,
simon: me and JJ went on a jog down Oxford Street and it was literally, we saw six people.
simon: But it was literally, you're going down the busiest street in London
randolph: and
simon: there's six
simon: people.
randolph: Yeah, that's
simon: mad.
simon: It was good.
simon: Good times.
simon: Well, I can't wait to move into my house.
simon: I'm like, I keep seeing, I feel like all of us were so gassed to move into London
Unknown: and
simon: we're like, yeah, I want to, you know, I want to live in central London experience
simon: all of that.
simon: And now everyone just can't wait to be out of it.
randolph: Yeah.
simon: Yeah.
simon: We did get scammed though.
simon: Like you're all right.
simon: So
Unknown: like
randolph: it did feel very like.
vikstar: Although, yeah.
vikstar: At the same time though, actually it was kind of great for delivery food.
vikstar: I lived off
Unknown: like,
vikstar: because restaurants were shut, like, so all you could do was order
vikstar: and food.
vikstar: So I could just order and food nonstop, stream nonstop.
vikstar: So I can't complain too much.
vikstar: I
simon: mean, it was great for like our careers.
simon: Oh, for us, yeah.
simon: It was actually a good place
vikstar: to be, I think actually.
simon: Although, if we were in the house for lockdown, it would have been lit.
vikstar: Yeah, true.
vikstar: Because
simon: we had a garden, we had a pool, we had a gym.
vikstar: Content would have been.
vikstar: Yeah.
vikstar: It would have been literally like, let's film some videos.
vikstar: I'm bored.
vikstar: Yeah.
simon: I think we would have.
simon: I mean, yeah, both worked out kind of for us.
vikstar: We should have made more, more Sidemen gaming videos during lockdown.
vikstar: What were we doing?
vikstar: Oh yeah.
vikstar: I think back, what were we actually doing?
simon: We were all just streaming.
simon: It was.
simon: Everyone was streaming.
simon: We should
vikstar: have
Unknown: just
vikstar: streamed games together and recorded it.
vikstar: True.
randolph: It was kind of good though.
randolph: In a way, like I actually, the first one, I mean, everyone kind of says the first one
randolph: felt good.
randolph: Obviously it was bad, like for the world, but
Unknown: like.
randolph: I mean, I agree.
randolph: I know what you mean.
randolph: But the air was Sidemen.
randolph: Because you just wake up and just fucking game all day and not feel bad.
randolph: Yeah.
randolph: Because the thing is, you'd feel bad, right?
randolph: You'd feel like, oh, I should probably do something properly now.
randolph: Before, you would never do it, man.
randolph: You'd just go for it.
randolph: It's like sick.
Unknown: But
randolph: yeah, but the house has been good.
vikstar: No, yeah, it's very
randolph: nice.
randolph: Have you still got
Unknown: rooms
randolph: that you don't use?
randolph: Yes.
randolph: How does that feel?
randolph: Because for me, that's kind of weird.
randolph: Yeah.
randolph: Also, I'm slowly filling in the furniture room.
randolph: I'm not rushing it.
randolph: I don't need to get everything done.
randolph: So some places are just a little empty.
randolph: It's really weird.
randolph: No, yeah.
vikstar: There's a few empty rooms.
vikstar: But it was good because we had loads of people staying with us around.
vikstar: Why did everyone
Unknown: come
vikstar: here?
vikstar: I just, at one point.
vikstar: Charity match and
simon: boxing.
simon: Did they just have boxing?
vikstar: Yeah.
simon: Or charity match.
vikstar: It was not.
vikstar: It was because we went to Tomorrowland.
vikstar: And it also happened because that's when Lachlan came, Rob came.
vikstar: Yeah.
vikstar: Some of Ellie's friends from overseas came.
randolph: Nice.
vikstar: And we had a full house.
vikstar: Oh, you did for a long time, right?
vikstar: Yeah, and then Lannan just stayed because he couldn't get a visa.
vikstar: Oh, he's been here for ages, right?
vikstar: He comes back and forth.
vikstar: He was here.
vikstar: He was here for about two months.
vikstar: Then it was good to go and see him.
vikstar: I was like, I'm staying at your house now.
simon: Yeah, true, true.
simon: In
vikstar: my
simon: head, your house, because you know you did your house tour
vikstar: and
simon: it was quite empty
simon: at that point.
simon: In my head, it's still that.
simon: It's still fairly empty.
simon: Oh, is it actually?
vikstar: Yeah.
vikstar: No, it's
Unknown: like 25
vikstar: % done.
simon: Okay.
vikstar: It's getting there.
vikstar: It's a very, we've been
Unknown: quite
vikstar: meh getting it done.
vikstar: It's one of those things where it's
Unknown: just,
vikstar: you just kind of like, you forget
vikstar: to follow up on stuff and then just nothing happens.
randolph: Well, it's because you live in the parts that you live in.
vikstar: That's it.
vikstar: You
randolph: don't need the other stuff necessarily.
randolph: It just needs to look good.
randolph: Or if you have guests around and stuff.
randolph: So it's like, I don't need a sofa just for the room.
randolph: I don't go in
Unknown: it.
vikstar: Yeah.
vikstar: But it
randolph: looks weird with that one.
vikstar: I would say everything is functional.
vikstar: The full house is functional.
vikstar: But in terms of decoration and filling spaces,
simon: it's
vikstar: still a long way.
vikstar: I was supposed to do a video like this year.
vikstar: I was like, this is everything I've done.
vikstar: That was last summer.
vikstar: Like a new house tour.
vikstar: Yeah, yeah, a new house tour.
vikstar: I'm like, maybe next year.
vikstar: Give me another year.
simon: Well, you've got your gym.
simon: The gym is fully done.
simon: The gym,
vikstar: yeah, the gym.
vikstar: And that looks sick.
vikstar: I'm very, very happy with that.
vikstar: I spend,
Unknown: yeah,
vikstar: a lot of time in there.
randolph: Yeah.
vikstar: Instead of making videos, I'm
Unknown: just
vikstar: in that gym.
vikstar: In the gym, man.
vikstar: In the gym.
vikstar: It
randolph: does
vikstar: look really sick.
vikstar: I remember
randolph: watching that video.
randolph: Yeah, it's really,
vikstar: it's nice as well because it's, I just enjoy being there.
vikstar: So I can go and spend like two hours just like sat in there, just like being really
vikstar: lazy and slow with my workout.
vikstar: But it's just somewhere I want to be, like put on some music, turn down the lights.
Unknown: Just.
randolph: Because sometimes for me, like going to the gym is always like the long part.
randolph: Like actually getting out and going.
randolph: And
vikstar: it's finding the gap in the day.
vikstar: So sometimes you'll think, right, I've got 50 minutes.
vikstar: It's going to take me 10 minutes to get to the gym, then 10 minutes to get back.
vikstar: So then I'll have 30 minutes to gym.
vikstar: What's the point?
vikstar: Whereas like.
randolph: Yeah.
randolph: I'll fit it
vikstar: in.
vikstar: I can kind of be like working on stuff.
vikstar: Like if I know I've got a delivery coming or something, I'll be like, right, I'm
vikstar: going to go and start my workout.
vikstar: I'll stop for five minutes in the middle, go back to it.
vikstar: That's
randolph: sick.
randolph: My dad's currently putting my gym floor in, in my
Unknown: garage.
randolph: Damn.
simon: Yeah,
randolph: yeah.
randolph: Very nice.
randolph: Also, gym equipment is way more expensive than I thought it was.
vikstar: Oh yeah.
vikstar: It went up during lockdown.
vikstar: I feel like it's been up.
vikstar: During lockdown, so many people wanted home gym equipment.
vikstar: The prices went up.
randolph: Yeah.
vikstar: And they just left the prices.
vikstar: They just went, all right, you're not exactly all right.
vikstar: We're kind of rich now.
vikstar: Yeah, true, true.
vikstar: We'll leave the prices
randolph: up.
randolph: Look, even the, is that the AC?
vikstar: Yeah.
randolph: Even the AC is colour coordinated.
vikstar: It was white.
vikstar: They wrapped it.
vikstar: That's rad.
vikstar: That's so sick, man.
vikstar: Yeah, but the treadmill was like three grand.
vikstar: I'm like, fuck
Unknown: man.
vikstar: I still got the one Simon bought me.
vikstar: Class, class, class.
vikstar: That was a
simon: Simon video.
simon: Yeah.
simon: Nice,
vikstar: nice.
vikstar: And I still haven't activated the Peloton membership.
vikstar: I don't want it.
vikstar: I just want to run.
vikstar: True.
randolph: I was thinking that.
randolph: I was looking at the difference between Peloton and a regular one.
randolph: Am I just paying for the bloke to tell me what to do?
vikstar: I personally, I just don't, I just want, but it has a setting where you just press
vikstar: just run.
simon: Yeah.
vikstar: And you can set the incline and speed and that's all I want to do.
vikstar: I stick an iPad.
vikstar: It has this massive screen and I just have an iPad stuck on the massive screen with
vikstar: whatever I'm watching on
randolph: it.
randolph: But I'm
vikstar: like, it's crazy.
vikstar: It's like an, it's one of the most expensive treadmills and then you pay them like
vikstar: 40 quid a month or something on top.
vikstar: I swear it's a scam.
vikstar: But the thing is other people are like, yeah, I love how I do the classes.
vikstar: I take the classes offline.
vikstar: That's the thing I know Con does
simon: I think.
simon: Yeah.
simon: Con said that he uses like the other stuff.
simon: Like he'll just put it onto the TV, like a different TV and do the classes.
simon: I just love it.
simon: You can literally do like a yoga class on a different TV.
simon: You can sign in on any other room.
simon: So I think it is worth it if you,
vikstar: if that is how you work out.
vikstar: But for me, I'm
Unknown: just,
simon: if you want to just run, there's no point.
Unknown: Well,
simon: speaking of Simon videos, yes.
simon: The video that went
Unknown: out,
simon: this is next week.
vikstar: Okay.
Unknown: So
simon: young versus old just went out.
vikstar: Yeah.
vikstar: Young guns.
simon: Me and Vic were on the young team.
Unknown: You
simon: haven't seen it because it's not out yet.
vikstar: I've seen some
Unknown: clips.
simon: Yeah.
randolph: Yeah.
simon: Of the old
Unknown: team.
randolph: Yeah.
simon: Okay.
simon: We were on the young team
randolph: and
Unknown: it
simon: started off a bit stinky.
simon: Yeah.
simon: We went to KidZone.
simon: Right.
vikstar: Right.
simon: I'd been there before for-
simon: When you were a kid.
simon: And also another video.
vikstar: That same exact place or just edited?
vikstar: It was a different one.
vikstar: Okay.
simon: Yeah.
simon: But then we went to Whitewater rafting.
vikstar: Oh.
vikstar: And it
simon: was me, him, Toby and JJ.
simon: Yeah.
vikstar: Actually, you know what?
vikstar: They shouldn't have done it.
vikstar: Yeah.
vikstar: I'm very mixed.
vikstar: I was just about to say they should have done it, but then I actually realized how mad
vikstar: those rapids were.
simon: Yeah.
simon: Whose they?
simon: JJ and Toby didn't do it.
simon: Right.
simon: Okay.
simon: So me and Vic went in.
simon: It was me and Vic.
simon: In front of us, two instructors who, you know, literally do it every day.
simon: Instructor.
simon: Behind us, the main instructor who kind of controls it
vikstar: all.
simon: It was meant to
Unknown: be
simon: him, me, Vic, JJ, Toby.
vikstar: That would have been
Unknown: so
vikstar: funny.
simon: It literally, it didn't end well.
simon: We went down it once, went around the whole thing.
simon: You have to start off, you have to jump into the water.
vikstar: Okay.
simon: And then kind of just float down.
simon: Just to see how,
vikstar: yeah.
vikstar: Feel what it feels like to be in the water.
vikstar: Yeah.
simon: And then we went down at the second time and we kind of turn around on the rapids
Unknown: and
simon: try and
Unknown: like.
vikstar: Balance, basically.
vikstar: Yeah.
vikstar: Balance in the swell.
simon: Yeah.
simon: I didn't really get it.
vikstar: So that, I think what that is, is
Unknown: like,
vikstar: I think, I'm no expert, but I think in
vikstar: Whitewater rafting, it's important to be able to
Unknown: like
vikstar: control where you are and
vikstar: you need to be able to kind of hold your position on the rapids.
randolph: Okay.
randolph: I
vikstar: don't know, maybe, I don't know why.
vikstar: Maybe, I don't know, there's like a log.
vikstar: I don't know, that's fallen in front of you.
vikstar: I actually, I'm completely good at this stuff.
vikstar: Sounds good.
vikstar: It sounds really good.
vikstar: It seems like there is a reason to be able to try and hold yourself in a
vikstar: stack of points.
vikstar: They were trying to teach us to do that.
simon: So it was, yeah.
simon: So we turn around and then we go into the rapids and the guy is like,
randolph: lean left.
simon: And me and Vic have to lean left.
simon: Really?
simon: Right.
simon: Keep doing that.
Unknown: And
simon: eventually
Unknown: we
simon: started tipping a lot.
randolph: Yeah.
simon: And then they basically, the whole thing just flipped.
vikstar: Yeah.
simon: And we ended up, I ended up under the raft.
simon: I didn't see what happened to you.
simon: I didn't
vikstar: hit myself in the chin with my oar.
simon: He told you to hold on.
vikstar: But when you're
Unknown: flipping.
simon: Yeah, man.
simon: And then, yeah, we just went, got sent down and.
simon: But it was fun
randolph: though.
simon: I actually really enjoyed it to be fair.
simon: I did
vikstar: really enjoy it.
vikstar: Because the fact you went
randolph: in on your own first to feel it out, like
randolph: when you fall in, it's like same as that, right?
randolph: Yeah, it was.
randolph: Without the canoe on your head.
randolph: Or whatever you're on.
randolph: Yeah, it was a
vikstar: inflatable raft.
vikstar: But
Unknown: doing
vikstar: that in an actual like plastic canoe, I think I would die.
vikstar: I would just get stuck upside down.
vikstar: After the round.
simon: I actually
randolph: haven't done
simon: that.
simon: Really?
simon: White water in the canoe?
simon: In the canoe, yeah.
simon: In a solo canoe?
randolph: We had two of
Unknown: us.
randolph: Wow.
randolph: It was PGL.
randolph: I was
Unknown: in like
randolph: year six.
Unknown: Were
simon: they quite
Unknown: big
simon: rapids?
randolph: Yeah, they're of decent size.
randolph: They're sick.
randolph: This doesn't
vikstar: sound safe.
Unknown: But
randolph: then
vikstar: again, when we were kids, health and safety didn't really matter.
vikstar: True, true.
randolph: PGL, which I'm pretty sure is stuff like parents get lost, right?
vikstar: I don't know what PGL is.
vikstar: Oh, I'm sure it's like
randolph: a school trip we went on.
vikstar: I was fucking sick though.
randolph: So good, man.
randolph: Is it a time in age where like, you know when you do something
randolph: pairs at school and you're like picking partners?
randolph: And then we had this friend and I was like, I'm with you, right?
randolph: Dynamic duo?
randolph: Yeah, yeah.
randolph: And then someone else asked him, can I be on your team?
randolph: No, I'm with Andrew.
vikstar: I'm with Big Randy.
vikstar: You're gonna get fucked made of shit.
randolph: Go with the loser kid, man.
vikstar: Like squid game where they just die.
randolph: So Toby and JJ just didn't want to do
Unknown: it?
simon: Yeah.
randolph: I mean, it is very scary.
randolph: It looks very frightening.
simon: It's not
randolph: just swimming, you know.
randolph: Well,
simon: when we jumped in and then when we went down the first time
simon: and it was very calm, I was thinking, you lot are like,
simon: you should have done
vikstar: this.
vikstar: I think it was very calm though because we had three professional
vikstar: whitewater racquet members with us.
vikstar: I
simon: think the guy behind us could have done it on his own.
simon: But Donny was
vikstar: like, all's
simon: up and then he's just doing it.
vikstar: And I
simon: think
Unknown: we
simon: would have struggled a bit.
vikstar: Yeah, true.
vikstar: He would have always kept it.
simon: But I think the last one, 100%, they would have had a
simon: terrible time.
vikstar: They would have actually thought they were going to die.
vikstar: Good content.
simon: Like, yeah.
simon: JJ would have had good content there.
randolph: But you also got your face painted?
simon: I did, yeah.
randolph: Also, he turned up.
randolph: Bro, I went to a podcast last week with Nathan Dore.
randolph: My guy turns up with eyeliner on.
randolph: Do you look like young men?
simon: That was good.
simon: Ever since that.
simon: So as soon as I had the eyeliner on, it was afterwards.
simon: I've washed it all off and I can't get rid of this bit.
simon: And then we had the Sidemen party and I still couldn't
simon: get rid of it.
simon: So I turned up and I've got this
vikstar: bit.
vikstar: With the smokey eye.
vikstar: But suddenly he
simon: just went, oh, I just thought
simon: you were tired.
simon: Bro, Charlie Roxford must be like, my guy.
simon: Not here.
simon: It wasn't like a bag.
simon: It was a line.
randolph: Yeah.
simon: It wasn't a bag.
simon: It was a line.
simon: Shit, bro.
simon: Take that one out.
simon: Sidemen party
vikstar: was crazy.
randolph: Sidemen party
simon: actually was crazy.
simon: It was.
simon: It was all right.
simon: I thought it was all right.
simon: Yeah.
simon: I compare it to last year and I really like
simon: last year's one.
vikstar: We were pretty hands on last year.
simon: I
vikstar: remember,
Unknown: like,
vikstar: I went even to check out
vikstar: the venue before.
vikstar: Take some keyboards out of the trees.
vikstar: Oh, that was so bad.
vikstar: They were like, gamer party, let's hang
vikstar: keyboards and mice out of the tree.
vikstar: I was like, take all of that out now.
vikstar: It's awful.
vikstar: I'm insulted.
simon: I think it's because this year we had
simon: our charity match so recently.
vikstar: Yeah.
vikstar: That
Unknown: we
simon: saw that as our party.
simon: Yeah, I didn't really want
vikstar: to do one.
vikstar: Yeah, this was more of
simon: like a
simon: it's all being done.
vikstar: I think eight was also cool
vikstar: because we were launching sides
vikstar: and XIX.
vikstar: Yeah.
vikstar: Whereas this year,
vikstar: the charity match was our
vikstar: big thing of the year.
vikstar: The Sidemen turning nine,
vikstar: it's like, hey, great, we're old.
simon: Well, next year, 10 years.
simon: That should be.
simon: And that has to be.
simon: That has to be good.
Unknown: Like,
simon: it has to be
simon: way bigger.
simon: It looks,
vikstar: the party looks cool.
simon: The photos make it look really cool.
simon: True, true.
simon: Shout out ChipFat as
Unknown: well.
randolph: It's actually nice to see JJ
randolph: at a party as
Unknown: well.
vikstar: I didn't see him.
vikstar: There were so many people.
randolph: Yeah, he's getting bigger like that, isn't it?
randolph: I actually
simon: feel bad for him, you know?
randolph: Yeah.
randolph: Because I
simon: was doing the classic
simon: walk around, say hi to everyone.
randolph: Yeah.
simon: And everyone, you know, wants to say
simon: hi to all the Sidemen kind of thing.
simon: But JJ gets it way more.
simon: Yeah, he's getting photos
vikstar: as
Unknown: well.
vikstar: And he doesn't drink.
vikstar: Yeah, that's true.
vikstar: That's the worst part.
vikstar: But he does
simon: turn up, like,
simon: with an hour left.
simon: He's like,
simon: I
vikstar: feel like he was there.
vikstar: He turned up
Unknown: at 11?
Unknown: I feel
simon: like he was there
vikstar: for a bit.
vikstar: I think he was there at least two hours.
vikstar: Yeah, I
simon: think he was 11 till 1.
vikstar: Yeah.
simon: I think he was there.
vikstar: If you have enough, better
vikstar: take all the selfies in the world.
vikstar: True, true, true.
randolph: I actually,
randolph: bro, I had a shot,
randolph: who was it?
randolph: It was like,
randolph: ChipFat and a bunch of
Unknown: them
randolph: coming to do a shot,
randolph: right,
randolph: of the XX World Cup.
randolph: But they did it in, like,
randolph: a regular cup,
randolph: rather than a shot glass.
randolph: And they poured,
randolph: it was like,
randolph: They poured it
vikstar: themselves.
vikstar: No, no, they poured four of them.
vikstar: It was
randolph: like this much.
simon: Yeah, you did it
simon: just before I did.
simon: Because I went over to the bar
simon: and they all said, like,
simon: oh, we're doing a shot.
simon: I did
randolph: that one with
Unknown: you.
simon: Yeah.
simon: And that was so easy.
simon: I went, oh, yeah,
simon: we're all doing a shot.
simon: And you were like,
simon: oh, don't do it, bro.
simon: It was like this.
simon: And then they poured a shot
simon: and it was,
simon: it was a shot.
simon: Like it was a tiny shot.
randolph: They fucking killed us, man.
randolph: No wonder Chip Fat, like,
randolph: was out of it.
randolph: I
simon: think it's because
simon: it was a triple what you did.
vikstar: I heard Chip Fat.
vikstar: I think there was a meme
vikstar: with Chip Fat where it was like,
vikstar: if you go and do a shot
vikstar: with Chip Fat,
vikstar: it has to be a triple.
vikstar: Right, that makes sense.
vikstar: Chip Fat's only allowed
vikstar: to do triple shots
vikstar: because he wants to
Unknown: do
vikstar: more than 20 shots,
vikstar: which is what he did
vikstar: at the last year.
vikstar: He did that last
simon: year, yeah.
vikstar: If you end up, like,
vikstar: throwing up on the floor
vikstar: for 20 shots,
vikstar: why would you want to do more?
simon: True, true.
simon: This man.
simon: That's what working
randolph: and vodka for me as well,
randolph: like, doing too much
randolph: just like, oh, man.
randolph: Yeah.
randolph: I'm a cultured man now.
randolph: I enjoy them, you know.
vikstar: You've always been a cultured man.
vikstar: Randy in the club
vikstar: with a cigar and a whiskey.
randolph: True, true.
randolph: Very
vikstar: cultured man.
randolph: But I actually, like,
randolph: I had that shot.
randolph: I guess now it's a triple.
randolph: Now it makes sense.
randolph: That adds up
randolph: with why I ate so much.
vikstar: We're breaking it down.
randolph: I actually had to go
randolph: to the toilet.
randolph: I was like,
randolph: I'm going to throw
Unknown: up.
randolph: But I got there
randolph: and it was really busy.
randolph: I was like,
randolph: OK, never mind.
simon: So if it wasn't busy,
simon: you would have just thrown up?
simon: I
randolph: actually would have.
randolph: Yeah.
randolph: But I got there
randolph: and I was like,
randolph: OK, I'll just wash my hands and
Unknown: leave.
simon: All
Unknown: right.
randolph: But it is fun.
randolph: Fun to see everyone.
randolph: I loved that chili drink,
Unknown: man.
randolph: The Picante.
randolph: Yeah, I've had that before.
vikstar: Cultured man.
vikstar: That was really nice.
vikstar: You know,
vikstar: I don't usually drink Negroni's
vikstar: and we had loads of them on tap there
vikstar: and I
Unknown: was
vikstar: sinking them.
randolph: Really?
randolph: I had one
randolph: and then I skipped to the Picante.
vikstar: The thing is,
vikstar: I think I was on my
Unknown: sixth
randolph: and
vikstar: I'd forgotten
vikstar: who I was talking to
vikstar: and they're
Unknown: like,
vikstar: oh, I tried one of those Negroni's
vikstar: they're really, really strong
vikstar: and I'm like,
vikstar: am I wasted?
vikstar: Am I going to be
simon: wasted?
simon: I mean, the fact you said,
simon: I can't remember
simon: what I was talking
randolph: to
simon: you.
simon: It shows in my bit of it.
randolph: I left quite early
randolph: because we did pitch side before
randolph: and we've
Unknown: got
randolph: just plaster doing that.
randolph: I heard about that.
randolph: It's just non-stop.
randolph: When you talk about mixers,
randolph: would you mean the drink
randolph: or would you mean
randolph: the Coke and Fanta
randolph: and lemonade and stuff?
simon: The mixer is the soft drink.
randolph: Yeah, that's what I thought.
randolph: So Elliot Hackney,
randolph: he was like,
randolph: oh, the mixers are
randolph: in the middle of the table.
randolph: So I took the Disserano bottle
randolph: to the table
randolph: and poured it.
randolph: Then I was expecting
randolph: to see all the mixers
randolph: like the Coke and there's none there.
randolph: So I just started drinking
randolph: the Disserano straight
randolph: as I was pouring my,
randolph: I was just drinking non-stop.
vikstar: Can we check this?
vikstar: Are we all wrong?
vikstar: No, I think you're right.
vikstar: I think you're a
simon: spirit
simon: and a
randolph: mixer.
vikstar: Yeah, it's a spirit.
vikstar: Or he
randolph: just said
randolph: the mixers were on the table
randolph: and they just were gone now.
randolph: That could have been true as well.
randolph: So I was just drinking
randolph: the Disserano straight
randolph: and I
Unknown: got
randolph: there.
randolph: Why is
vikstar: Disserano?
vikstar: What spirit is
Unknown: it?
randolph: Let's go, Nick.
Unknown: Did you burp on them, sir?
randolph: No, it wasn't.
randolph: It was sweet.
randolph: It was really sweet.
Unknown: It
randolph: was really sweet.
randolph: Maybe it's like a...
randolph: It is a...
randolph: Amaretto.
vikstar: Amaretto.
vikstar: Amaretto is a bit of...
vikstar: I'm a bit of a guy
vikstar: for amaretto.
vikstar: Yeah, it was really
randolph: nice.
vikstar: Amaretto season.
randolph: Yeah.
randolph: But I left quite early
randolph: at the party.
randolph: Also, what really
randolph: pissed me off, right,
randolph: is party.
randolph: I was drinking alcohol.
randolph: I had the triple shot
randolph: and I was like,
randolph: actually, I've had too much
randolph: to drink.
randolph: It's not good.
randolph: I thought I'd go outside
randolph: to the hot chocolate
randolph: and get a nice hot chocolate,
randolph: right?
simon: Yeah, the alcohol in it.
simon: Yeah, fucking put
randolph: rum in it.
randolph: I'm like,
randolph: bro, why'd you ruin it, man?
randolph: Someone drinking hot chocolate
randolph: with fucking rum
randolph: and I'm like,
randolph: bro, I just want to get away
randolph: from alcohol.
randolph: Please.
vikstar: Could you not have
vikstar: just asked one without?
vikstar: You definitely
randolph: could.
randolph: I've got a problem
randolph: with stuff like that.
simon: Like...
simon: You don't
randolph: want to miss out.
randolph: Yeah, man.
randolph: I can't really interrupt
randolph: someone and tell them to stop
randolph: because he was really excited
randolph: to give me the rum.
randolph: I was like,
randolph: can I get two hot chocolates, please?
randolph: He's like,
randolph: with rum, yeah?
randolph: I'm like, yeah.
Unknown: I
randolph: don't want to break his heart.
randolph: I'm like,
randolph: no, hold the rum, please.
randolph: That's all he's doing, man.
randolph: He's just pouring rum into...
randolph: That's his job.
vikstar: You don't want to take away
vikstar: his whole job.
randolph: I mean, he's day asking
randolph: for a hot chocolate.
randolph: But I should have asked
randolph: for that,
Unknown: though.
randolph: Yeah.
simon: When I had the...
simon: Just going back to
simon: when I had the eyeliner.
randolph: Yeah.
simon: You made a joke
simon: that I look like the kid
simon: that goes,
randolph: I want to kill Moe.
Unknown: Bro,
simon: have you seen
simon: that he now...
simon: He's doing a song
simon: with DDG.
vikstar: Sounds pretty
simon: fire.
simon: That was mad.
simon: I think they know
simon: each other, though.
Unknown: Because
simon: I saw him
simon: doing like
Unknown: a...
simon: Like a Q&A
simon: with the kid's dad.
randolph: I mean, you could do that
randolph: without knowing each other.
simon: Yeah, but the way
simon: they were talking,
simon: they weren't doing it
simon: like a,
simon: oh yeah, we've just met.
simon: They were literally
simon: insulting each other.
simon: I imagine
vikstar: the child
vikstar: was on a script
vikstar: for the viral moment.
vikstar: Imagine.
vikstar: The song was all part
vikstar: of the work.
vikstar: You never know these days.
vikstar: But
randolph: the kids
randolph: could have done more
randolph: than just that one song
randolph: before, you know.
randolph: I saw him at a party
randolph: as well,
randolph: saying the same shit.
vikstar: I want to kill my granddad.
vikstar: I went there
vikstar: and tuned in
vikstar: I want to kill my mum.
randolph: That's true.
randolph: JJ was going to flip
randolph: because JJ was mad
randolph: at the songs recently, right?
randolph: Oh, yeah.
randolph: JJ's
simon: very angry.
simon: He put in the chat
simon: about
Unknown: how
simon: music now,
simon: he was like,
simon: oh, look at the top
simon: two songs.
simon: It's Lil Uzi Vert's
simon: new song
simon: and Poland
simon: by Lil Yachty.
simon: It's like,
simon: neither of them are even songs.
randolph: They're only a minute long.
randolph: To be fair,
randolph: he said himself
randolph: that I'm a boomer.
randolph: Yeah, he said I'm a boomer.
randolph: He wasn't saying
randolph: in The World of Change
randolph: he was saying
randolph: I'm kind of getting old.
randolph: But I don't know, man.
randolph: But even that Poland song
randolph: it just went viral.
randolph: I don't think it was supposed
randolph: to be
Unknown: on
randolph: Spotify.
randolph: I think it's a banger.
randolph: It's pretty good.
randolph: I don't really
simon: think
simon: it's a banger.
randolph: The Fortnite remix.
randolph: He's like
randolph: I took the sluv
randolph: to
Unknown: tilter.
randolph: That's so bad.
randolph: Nah, bro.
randolph: I thought that was
randolph: going to be
randolph: at least word play.
randolph: Nah, man.
randolph: Wasn't even close.
randolph: But it banged.
randolph: How does
vikstar: it bang?
randolph: It sounds really good.
randolph: Does it just sound
randolph: like the song
randolph: with different words?
randolph: Yeah, but the guy
randolph: did it really well.
randolph: It's really chill.
randolph: It actually has a vibe.
randolph: I hear
vikstar: it now.
randolph: Can we get it?
randolph: I mean, I'll play it
randolph: but
Unknown: my
randolph: TikToks
randolph: are full
Unknown: of
randolph: memes already.
randolph: You know what?
randolph: TikTok's actually got
randolph: a really good search
randolph: these
Unknown: days.
randolph: It's got far better
randolph: than it used
simon: to
Unknown: be.
vikstar: Hold on,
simon: hold on, hold on.
simon: A connoisseur.
randolph: A connoisseur.
randolph: Yeah, yeah.
Unknown: Are
simon: you finding it?
randolph: Yeah, I'm gonna find it.
randolph: There you go.
randolph: Got
Unknown: it.
Unknown: I
vikstar: took the
Unknown: sluv
vikstar: I
Unknown: took the sluv
vikstar: I took the sluv
vikstar: It's the tone change
vikstar: with the half-witted slav.
vikstar: Yeah, you
randolph: actually like
randolph: it's a vibe,
Unknown: man.
vikstar: 2022, man.
vikstar: Bro, I've
randolph: been playing
randolph: No Build on Fortnite
randolph: it's fucking sick.
vikstar: Yeah?
randolph: It's just fun.
vikstar: Have you played Overwatch 2?
vikstar: I haven't played it yet.
simon: I've been playing non-stop.
vikstar: It's good.
simon: I've been playing so much.
simon: You're playing
vikstar: competitive?
simon: Yeah.
vikstar: What rank?
simon: Tin.
simon: I'm up.
simon: Oh, it's a gold five on damage.
vikstar: Yeah?
simon: But yeah, that's not very good.
simon: Do you have
vikstar: a different
vikstar: rank for every class this time?
vikstar: Yeah.
simon: And you can also do open queue
simon: and then that's a different rank.
simon: Yeah.
vikstar: I might have to get involved.
simon: J.J. bangs it out.
vikstar: Really?
simon: Bangs it out.
simon: He's the only good
vikstar: rank.
simon: He's plat on
simon: damage I think
simon: but he plays console.
randolph: Yeah.
randolph: He's control.
randolph: Yeah,
simon: he came to play
simon: on a PC one time
simon: and he was just like
simon: yeah, the same for me.
randolph: It's different.
randolph: It's different.
randolph: Gamers are different.
randolph: When you say PC
randolph: you're still with controller.
randolph: He
simon: still plays controller, yeah.
simon: Okay.
simon: But any time he goes up against
simon: the Hanzo
simon: that is a sniper kind of character
Unknown: they
simon: just fuck him up.
simon: Yeah.
vikstar: What's it like these days?
vikstar: Is it still
vikstar: balanced between
vikstar: keyboard and mouse
vikstar: and controller
vikstar: or is there one that's
simon: I mean keyboard and
vikstar: mouse
vikstar: is better.
simon: Yeah.
simon: I
vikstar: love that.
vikstar: No, that's what I want.
vikstar: I mean the
simon: game is still
simon: I say I love the game
simon: it's Overwatch 1
Unknown: again
simon: there's just three new characters
simon: with one less
vikstar: hero
vikstar: and a few new heroes
Unknown: and
simon: there's like a new map
simon: and that's it
simon: and it's like
simon: I'm just kind of using it
simon: until COD comes out.
vikstar: Yeah.
vikstar: Which it was really funny
vikstar: we were sat
vikstar: we went to like a
vikstar: gaming bar in Melbourne
vikstar: which is actually quite sick
vikstar: which is weird
vikstar: it was like a gaming bar
vikstar: with
Unknown: a
vikstar: vibe
Unknown: which
vikstar: I would never expect
vikstar: it kind of helped that
vikstar: they were having packs
vikstar: at the same time
Unknown: there
vikstar: so like they were
vikstar: gamers in town
Unknown: but
vikstar: they had
vikstar: they had a stream up
vikstar: and it
Unknown: was
vikstar: Overwatch
vikstar: and me and Rob was sat there
vikstar: and we're
Unknown: like
vikstar: it's Overwatch 1 or 2
simon: we genuinely cannot count
simon: it is genuinely the same game
Unknown: yeah
simon: such a shame
randolph: I don't know how to play
randolph: but I was playing once
randolph: on a stream
randolph: I was in like a 24 hour stream
randolph: right and I was Winston
randolph: yeah
randolph: and I didn't know
randolph: until like 10 minutes into the game
randolph: that his gun only works
randolph: close range
Unknown: right
simon: sort of out here
simon: trying
randolph: to snipe people
randolph: yeah I was just like
randolph: from a distance
randolph: I tried shooting people
Unknown: and
randolph: in the chat
vikstar: but I
randolph: didn't even know
randolph: I was not getting anyone
randolph: I didn't know how the game works
randolph: so I was
Unknown: just
randolph: in my own little world
randolph: I'm like
randolph: damn
randolph: this is pretty fun
Unknown: man
randolph: everyone's like
randolph: just shooting electric bro
randolph: bro you're not
randolph: you're doing nothing
randolph: Brandy just stood in his spawn
randolph: Winston
Unknown: I
randolph: don't know
randolph: the game's always felt
randolph: confusing to me
randolph: like
Unknown: I
randolph: don't get it
randolph: at all
vikstar: I get why
vikstar: you don't get it
vikstar: I'm sure I will
vikstar: like if I tried
randolph: but
vikstar: it's one of those games
vikstar: you've got to understand
vikstar: all the abilities
vikstar: before you understand the game
randolph: yeah
randolph: whereas Valorant
randolph: is very self explanatory
randolph: oh no
randolph: I'm the same
randolph: I watch
vikstar: Valorant
vikstar: and I don't know
vikstar: what's going on
vikstar: really?
vikstar: there's like
vikstar: things flying around walls
vikstar: like
Unknown: different
simon: goo
vikstar: areas
vikstar: so it's just knowledge then
vikstar: the
simon: only thing about Valorant
simon: is it's much slower
Unknown: in
simon: terms of like
simon: yeah
simon: because obviously
simon: it's like one life
simon: you literally
simon: kind of go in
simon: and then
simon: you have one battle
simon: when you're
Unknown: out
simon: whereas overwatch
simon: you're literally like
simon: you respawned
simon: just run in
simon: run back
randolph: but each hero
randolph: has got a different gun though
Unknown: right?
randolph: on overwatch
randolph: are they all the same?
simon: is it all electric?
simon: they've all got different
randolph: guns
randolph: but I
simon: mean
simon: you literally
Unknown: just
simon: press fire
simon: and you can pretty much
simon: tell what it is
simon: oh
randolph: I'll give it a go
randolph: I haven't played like
randolph: 10 minutes turned
Unknown: off
randolph: it's stressing me out man
randolph: everyone in the chat
randolph: was like
randolph: you don't even do anything
randolph: 10 minutes you didn't
simon: do any damage
randolph: yeah I killed one guy
randolph: finally
Unknown: but
randolph: you think
Unknown: I
randolph: think yeah
randolph: it's not up to cross
simon: the map
simon: with Winston
randolph: but the gaming world is dry though
randolph: I feel like
randolph: there's no games man
randolph: I feel bad for some streamers
randolph: what are they doing?
vikstar: or even gaming YouTubers
vikstar: gaming streamers
randolph: although
simon: COD
simon: COD
simon: by the time this comes out
simon: COD is out
randolph: multiplayer
simon: you gonna get on
Unknown: it?
vikstar: probably not multiplayer
vikstar: I think I will actually
vikstar: probably need to though
vikstar: to get stuff for Warzone
vikstar: yeah
randolph: that was the smartest thing
randolph: they did for actual
randolph: the 2019 Warzone
randolph: so many people bought
randolph: they did yeah
randolph: you buy
vikstar: every COD
vikstar: to get guns
vikstar: otherwise what
randolph: was it
randolph: plummet?
vikstar: plunder
vikstar: and that was sick though
vikstar: when you could do
vikstar: helicopter concept
vikstar: you'd do the supply runs
vikstar: and you'd max a gun
vikstar: in like two hours
vikstar: and then they'd patch that
vikstar: and I was like
vikstar: now what
simon: now I'm sad
simon: I feel like
simon: I'm the only person
simon: that I've met
simon: that really has enjoyed
simon: COD multiplayer
simon: for the last three years
simon: because you
vikstar: didn't play
vikstar: the originals
vikstar: true
vikstar: yeah you didn't rinse
vikstar: the originals
vikstar: I put like
vikstar: probably 70 days
vikstar: into like
vikstar: COD 4 World at War
vikstar: Modern Warfare 2
vikstar: Black Ops 1
vikstar: Black Ops
Unknown: 2
vikstar: Black
simon: Ops 1 I did
Unknown: but
simon: I think that was it
simon: Modern Warfare 2
simon: was the one that
simon: I got into
simon: we should bring back
vikstar: more Sidemen
vikstar: COD wager matches
vikstar: I hope they have them
vikstar: in Modern Warfare 2
vikstar: I don't think they will
vikstar: because it was more
vikstar: wager
simon: matches were the
vikstar: they were in
vikstar: Black
Unknown: Ops
simon: this is the one where
simon: you like sticks
vikstar: and stones

simon: six men
simon: he's
randolph: like
simon: and I remembered
simon: my chicken was ready
simon: it's like
simon: it's just top step
simon: and then he just runs down
simon: and he goes
simon: bang bang bang
simon: and he goes
simon: then he ran at me
simon: like an angry baboon
simon: and I
Unknown: said
Unknown: sit
simon: down bitch
randolph: he's generally so funny
simon: I
randolph: remember
randolph: I might have thought
randolph: it was on the last podcast
randolph: but I don't know
randolph: I'll just tell it again
randolph: but I was with
randolph: I did a
randolph: game against Castro
randolph: on FIFA
randolph: and we were talking about JJ
Unknown: and
randolph: he was like
randolph: oh you're good at FIFA though right
randolph: I was like
randolph: no
randolph: they put me and Castro
randolph: on like 1v1
randolph: and the loser gets slimed
randolph: so obviously I got slimed
randolph: because the guy plays it
randolph: like a living
simon: and
randolph: then he was like
randolph: oh no but you're sick at FIFA
randolph: you beat JJ right
Unknown: and
randolph: I was like
randolph: yeah
randolph: JJ is shit at FIFA
randolph: really like
randolph: not good at all
randolph: he was like
randolph: he was a FIFA YouTuber
randolph: I'm like
Unknown: yeah
randolph: it wasn't about being good at FIFA
randolph: it was about being entertaining
randolph: well back
simon: then as well
simon: it was easy to be
simon: good at FIFA
simon: it was very like
randolph: most FIFA's now
randolph: you just views the
randolph: what's good
simon: and he would have done that
simon: yeah
simon: I
randolph: mean back in the day
randolph: he's better than me
randolph: but I
Unknown: mean
randolph: he still would beat me now
randolph: I'm not great
randolph: but it's not hard
randolph: although
simon: he stopped
Unknown: playing
randolph: has he?
randolph: now I watch
simon: he was bagging the game out
simon: and he was like
simon: yeah I'm in Div 6
simon: this is my new team
simon: you know
simon: he'd link cards in the chat
simon: and stuff like that
simon: and everyone was like
simon: what the fuck is going on
simon: is the new FIFA
vikstar: out?
vikstar: yeah
simon: yeah it came out
simon: end of September
vikstar: yikes
simon: and
vikstar: they
simon: recorded clubs the other day
vikstar: yeah
simon: me and you
simon: oh
vikstar: you weren't there
vikstar: no
simon: no
simon: yeah it was
vikstar: Harry said he didn't enjoy it
vikstar: apparently
vikstar: Harry
simon: doesn't like clubs
vikstar: oh?
simon: because whenever we've recorded
simon: it's
Unknown: like
simon: you don't enjoy clubs
simon: much
simon: like
simon: it's fun
simon: but it's not
simon: it's not your thing
simon: actually
vikstar: I don't enjoy
vikstar: as much as it just doesn't
vikstar: it's
vikstar: I think the videos are good
vikstar: but they just don't do
Unknown: well
simon: yeah
simon: that's
vikstar: what
vikstar: that's what
vikstar: because it takes
vikstar: probably more time
vikstar: to record that than something
vikstar: oh
simon: 100%
vikstar: and then when it doesn't do as well
vikstar: I'm like
simon: it's because it was
simon: I feel like it was
simon: like an iconic
simon: more Sidemen series
vikstar: yeah
simon: I mean it was
vikstar: an iconic
vikstar: Sidemen channel series
vikstar: it was the first
vikstar: series we started
vikstar: on the Sidemen channel
Unknown: and
simon: then it just
simon: yeah it fell off
Unknown: like
simon: Among Us is now
simon: like
Unknown: a
simon: classic
simon: Sidemen series
simon: but yeah
simon: then Harry apparently
simon: doesn't enjoy clubs
Unknown: I
simon: heard it through the grapevine
simon: wow
simon: I was
randolph: confused
randolph: there you
Unknown: go
randolph: yeah
randolph: Sidemen fans are crying
Unknown: how could he
simon: well yeah
simon: I don't think clubs is coming back
simon: anytime soon now
simon: I'm
vikstar: not complaining
vikstar: I feel like
vikstar: I feel like there's so much
vikstar: we can do with that channel
simon: oh 100
Unknown: %
vikstar: I
simon: think
simon: it's actually
Unknown: it
simon: hurts me knowing that
simon: obviously you posted
simon: so many videos
Unknown: over
simon: the year
simon: like over so many years
simon: so have I
simon: so has Josh
vikstar: yeah
vikstar: so has Ethan
Unknown: and
simon: we can't
simon: get more Sidemen
simon: posting
simon: like
simon: we struggle with
simon: 2 or 3 a week
simon: yeah
vikstar: we would do recordings
vikstar: but it was our whole life
simon: it was
simon: we
vikstar: would wake up
vikstar: to record
Unknown: for
vikstar: 4 hours
vikstar: to edit the videos
vikstar: to post them
vikstar: to do it again
vikstar: the next day
vikstar: but
simon: even still
simon: we would record
simon: for 4 hours
simon: now
simon: we record
Unknown: for
simon: like 2 hours
simon: and people's attention spans
simon: are gone
vikstar: it was so much easier
vikstar: back then as well
vikstar: because we just had
vikstar: to record the content
Unknown: and
vikstar: make the content good
vikstar: and
Unknown: I
vikstar: was posting
vikstar: GTA
vikstar: episode 432
simon: now you need the title
simon: now you need
vikstar: the title
vikstar: and the thumbnail
vikstar: or no one's gonna click it
vikstar: so it was a different time
vikstar: we were able to do
Unknown: that
Unknown: we
vikstar: could record
vikstar: so much volume
vikstar: but it doesn't
vikstar: it's not about recording
vikstar: volume on YouTube
vikstar: at the moment
Unknown: yeah
simon: but still
simon: I think
Unknown: we
simon: like
simon: some of us
simon: have gone through the phase
Unknown: of
simon: just grinding
simon: for 12 hours a day
simon: we could sit there
Unknown: and
Unknown: if
simon: we had the ideas there
Unknown: would
simon: you happily
simon: like would you happily
simon: sit there
simon: you go one day
simon: I'd spend 6
vikstar: hours
vikstar: recording gaming
vikstar: for more time
vikstar: as long as everything works
randolph: as long as
randolph: I'm sat waiting
randolph: and if you're enjoying
randolph: the games as well
randolph: it goes by really quick
randolph: because if you're not
randolph: enjoying the game
randolph: it's like it just drags
simon: and also if yeah
simon: if something doesn't work
simon: like the Among Us mod
simon: the second that happened
simon: and we spent 2 hours
vikstar: sick thumbnails
vikstar: back then when
simon: thumbnails
simon: didn't matter
simon: short and sweet
vikstar: clips
vikstar: short and sweet clips
vikstar: bro
simon: do you think
simon: right
simon: if
simon: say you were doing
simon: these videos
simon: 11 years ago
vikstar: yes
simon: and you had today's
simon: thumbnails
Unknown: do
simon: you think people
Unknown: would
simon: like
simon: they would do way
Unknown: better
vikstar: I'm sorry
vikstar: I don't know what's
vikstar: happening
Unknown: sorry
simon: raining care packages
simon: I think
vikstar: we crashed
vikstar: yeah
vikstar: I think we crashed them
vikstar: oh my god
vikstar: I love this fucking game though
vikstar: I think we crashed the game
vikstar: do you think the graphics
vikstar: I don't know why
vikstar: oh my
simon: god
vikstar: oh yeah
vikstar: oh
simon: my
randolph: god
randolph: yo that's sick
Unknown: that is sick
randolph: bro
randolph: you know what
randolph: you know
randolph: look at this description
randolph: look at the description
randolph: we like that and everything
Unknown: and
randolph: also
randolph: you would have been creasing
randolph: however old you were
randolph: no I know
simon: I can picture
simon: your fucking voices
simon: or your little
simon: squeaky voices
simon: oh my
Unknown: god
vikstar: see I miss
simon: content like that
simon: yeah yeah yeah
simon: like the little
simon: short videos like that
simon: imagine
vikstar: you drop
vikstar: that on your channel
vikstar: today
vikstar: 30 seconds of care package
vikstar: is falling
vikstar: what the fuck is this
vikstar: but I guess
Unknown: that's
simon: that
vikstar: could be a short
vikstar: it could be a TikTok
vikstar: it could be a TikTok
randolph: yeah
randolph: maybe content is going backwards
Unknown: just
randolph: better editors
randolph: yeah
Unknown: well
simon: back then as well
simon: if you posted
Unknown: that
simon: was before I even started
simon: but
simon: I remember you guys always saying
simon: if you posted a video
Unknown: like
simon: two a day back
Unknown: then
simon: everyone called you like a money whore
randolph: yeah
randolph: yeah
Unknown: whereas
simon: now if you don't post
Unknown: every
simon: five days
simon: everyone's like
simon: well this guy's lazy
vikstar: if someone else
vikstar: edited your video
vikstar: it was like
vikstar: wow
vikstar: you're such a
randolph: you're
vikstar: such a loser
vikstar: yeah
vikstar: you don't even care
vikstar: you don't even care
vikstar: about your channel
vikstar: yeah
vikstar: it makes no sense
vikstar: I'm an editor
vikstar: I'm paying someone
vikstar: to make this better
vikstar: wow
vikstar: you're so out of touch
Unknown: you
vikstar: don't even care
randolph: oh my
randolph: YouTube
Unknown: is
randolph: it's gone through
randolph: a really crazy cycle actually
randolph: but it's
randolph: obviously
Unknown: we're glad
vikstar: yeah
randolph: it turned out alright
vikstar: yeah
simon: that first video going out
simon: an editor's done
simon: was like
simon: terrifying
simon: I
vikstar: hope no one notices
simon: yeah
simon: oh my god
simon: if someone points out
simon: this thing
simon: or this
Unknown: thing
randolph: jump cut fucking hell
randolph: Simon that's not you
randolph: I can tell
randolph: yeah
simon: it's just crazy
simon: YouTube shorts as well
simon: is gonna start
Unknown: I
vikstar: hear everyone
vikstar: everyone's bigging up
vikstar: the YouTube shorts
vikstar: everyone is yeah
vikstar: well
simon: apparently they're gonna monetise
Unknown: it
simon: so
vikstar: properly
Unknown: yeah
simon: well it is clear that
Unknown: like
randolph: TikTok has like
randolph: shifted content
randolph: a
Unknown: lot
Unknown: so
randolph: they're probably looking at that
randolph: and trying to compete
Unknown: but
randolph: it looks like
randolph: they don't have to anymore
Unknown: because
randolph: aren't the US just gonna ban
Unknown: it
Unknown: well
randolph: I didn't know about this
randolph: is that
randolph: is that a thing
randolph: well JJ said it
randolph: so I believe it
randolph: JJ our political leader
vikstar: our business economic leader
vikstar: he does read a lot though
vikstar: I
simon: read nothing through the news
simon: so I actually only
simon: know what JJ puts in the chat
simon: he
vikstar: is a
simon: sucker for headlines
simon: he is
vikstar: and I think I'm one source
vikstar: I feel like he'll always have one source
vikstar: and he'll just believe that
vikstar: it's just a YouTube video
vikstar: his timeline
vikstar: his
simon: recommended
simon: video comes up
simon: and he's just like
simon: yo
simon: do you know Liz Truss was an
Unknown: alien
randolph: yeah bro
randolph: it's funny though
randolph: he enjoys it
simon: yeah
randolph: but I think
randolph: YouTube are
randolph: from what I hear
randolph: like really
randolph: trying to push the shorts
Unknown: but
randolph: will that get you back
vikstar: what's that
simon: will that get you back
Unknown: I
vikstar: don't know
vikstar: daily
vikstar: daily
vikstar: you could just do daily shorts
vikstar: my favourite shorts were Harry's
vikstar: Harry's
vikstar: Harry's shorts
simon: so
vikstar: good
vikstar: were incredible
vikstar: please
vikstar: please someone get this man
vikstar: another deal for sure
vikstar: what
randolph: is it
randolph: the egg
Unknown: one
randolph: remember the egg one
randolph: yeah
randolph: he's like
randolph: he goes like
Unknown: bro
randolph: I never knew
randolph: there was white eggs
randolph: so
randolph: he's like
randolph: I didn't know
randolph: he could do white eggs
randolph: then he cracks it
randolph: it just goes all over
randolph: his cooker
randolph: it's short
randolph: obviously
randolph: but it's really short
vikstar: I'd like to believe
vikstar: that this is stage
vikstar: and he thinks
vikstar: this is funny
vikstar: but he has
vikstar: I'm sure he's done this
vikstar: this is
simon: no
Unknown: way
vikstar: what a guy
simon: they're normal eggs
simon: they're just white
simon: that's it
randolph: no no no
randolph: watch
randolph: oh dear
randolph: and people are wondering
randolph: like damn
randolph: like Harry's
simon: what does he do
simon: on a day to day
simon: I bet it's like
simon: coming up with business ventures
simon: and video ideas
simon: it's just that
randolph: it's just funny
randolph: how a lot of content like that
randolph: and big moments just happen
randolph: like obviously
randolph: because I've been doing the side car
randolph: I just see all the
randolph: screenshots from the videos
randolph: yeah
randolph: I was thinking the same thing
randolph: like him hitting his mum
randolph: it's just
randolph: it wasn't supposed to
Unknown: happen
randolph: you
Unknown: know
Unknown: I
simon: think that's just the thing
simon: with videos in general
simon: stuff just goes right a lot
vikstar: yeah
simon: but you have to
vikstar: do enough
vikstar: and you have to create
vikstar: the right parameters
vikstar: for stuff to go right
vikstar: and then sometimes
vikstar: yeah you have videos
vikstar: where like
Unknown: an
vikstar: example being
vikstar: the Mr Beast video
randolph: that
vikstar: nothing remarkable
vikstar: happened in that video
vikstar: perhaps Nolan guessing
vikstar: like four doors in a row
vikstar: yeah
vikstar: that was pretty like
vikstar: wow
vikstar: but beyond that
vikstar: not a single remarkable thing
vikstar: happened in that video
vikstar: yeah
vikstar: it could have
randolph: but it
vikstar: just didn't
vikstar: and a lot of people would be
Unknown: like
vikstar: oh you know
vikstar: Sidemen used to be so much funnier
vikstar: when something else happened
vikstar: but it's just like
vikstar: sometimes stuff just doesn't
vikstar: yeah
vikstar: happen that way
simon: if you rely on something
simon: that is like a one take thing
simon: yeah
simon: you just have to hope
simon: that it goes right
simon: like the total wipeout we did
simon: where Ethan almost broke his back
simon: it's like
simon: I know that went wrong
simon: but it went right for content
simon: yeah
simon: now he's fine
simon: it's like
randolph: Dissolve Ball
randolph: him getting hit with that as well
randolph: even the
randolph: the holding a war video
randolph: I was just about to say that one
randolph: JJ just like
randolph: went crazy and it worked
vikstar: yeah
vikstar: yeah him doing water man
vikstar: it wasn't planned
vikstar: because he
simon: wasn't meant
simon: to even wear the thing
simon: it was like a bandana here
simon: and he was just going to
simon: wear it normally
simon: and then Toby put it
simon: on his own face
vikstar: yeah
simon: and then we were like
simon: oh it'd be funny for JJ
simon: because his hair will
simon: stick out the top
vikstar: and now he's on a tops card
vikstar: yeah
vikstar: and that
simon: character is like
simon: one of the funniest ones
simon: I actually really
randolph: want that
simon: card
simon: by the way
simon: I'm
vikstar: checking eBay for that
randolph: card
vikstar: Scouring
vikstar: yeah
vikstar: they all
randolph: got a water man
randolph: yeah
randolph: I'll buy it
vikstar: from you
vikstar: it looks fucking sick
randolph: even because he's got
randolph: like a pink background as well
randolph: it just looks really good
Unknown: yeah
vikstar: yeah
vikstar: there's so many things like that
vikstar: also in that video
vikstar: one of my favourite moments
vikstar: of that whole video
vikstar: is when JJ had to line his back
vikstar: with his legs up in the air
vikstar: and going through
vikstar: that was the first one
vikstar: yeah and the first one
vikstar: and that was so easy to do
vikstar: you just measure
vikstar: where your legs need to be
vikstar: you stick them up
vikstar: the wall would have gone past him
vikstar: no one would have laughed
vikstar: it would have been like
vikstar: oh nice good job
vikstar: instead he gets his legs
vikstar: too wide
vikstar: he gets folded over backwards
vikstar: falls face first
vikstar: it was so slow as well
vikstar: and it's hysterical
vikstar: yeah
vikstar: but that's content
vikstar: you just have to
vikstar: create the parameters
vikstar: I want to watch it again
vikstar: yeah
vikstar: it's so slow
vikstar: I actually watched the video
vikstar: like three times
Unknown: it's crazy
vikstar: you get folded
Unknown: in
vikstar: I could watch that all day
vikstar: and then there's Ethan
randolph: right holding his nose
Unknown: and
randolph: then letting go
randolph: and he actually goes
randolph: in the water
simon: yeah
simon: the
simon: when he does the bomb
simon: onto the platform
simon: so good
simon: I think it might be that spike
randolph: it's right at the end
randolph: it's very close to the end
randolph: what's that spike
Unknown: though?
vikstar: oh this was a disaster
vikstar: oh this
simon: is
simon: yeah this is bad
vikstar: it's just the wrong way
vikstar: no Tobi jumps
vikstar: I rate Tobi for trying
simon: but he jumps
Unknown: and
simon: ruins it
vikstar: oh see I see
vikstar: yeah
vikstar: he hits JJ's head
Unknown: yeah
simon: and that's where I got
simon: I got messed up with my back
Unknown: and
simon: then yeah
simon: go to the end
simon: I think it
Unknown: is
simon: there'll be
Unknown: a
simon: just check the spikes
simon: no no
simon: the one
Unknown: before
Unknown: is
randolph: it the end?
randolph: he's doing it there
randolph: the one before
randolph: the one before
randolph: that
Unknown: one
simon: yeah
simon: yeah
simon: yeah cause they both failed
simon: so we're like
simon: you have to go
Unknown: in
Unknown: is
vikstar: this where he tries
vikstar: to seat drop through
Unknown: the
Unknown: yeah
simon: he tries to
simon: yeah he tries to jump
simon: onto the thing
simon: and he holds his nose
vikstar: and then falls off
vikstar: holds his nose
Unknown: let's
vikstar: go
vikstar: yeah that video did really
vikstar: did really well as well right
simon: yeah
simon: fortunately
vikstar: yeah
Unknown: cause
vikstar: that could have
vikstar: been one that was big
vikstar: budget and just
vikstar: didn't go anywhere
vikstar: but
simon: we only found out
simon: on the day as well
simon: did you see how there's
simon: a big gap underneath it
simon: it wasn't meant to be
simon: there at all
randolph: okay
randolph: but
simon: they basically just
simon: did it and said
simon: there has to be a gap
simon: otherwise the thing
simon: will scrape and
Unknown: break
simon: so it kind of
simon: messed us up a bit
simon: it was way bigger than
randolph: it should have been
simon: yeah
simon: need to wait
vikstar: for them
vikstar: to cut some bits
Unknown: off
simon: between the bottom
simon: of
vikstar: the board
vikstar: and the floor
vikstar: and it was actually
vikstar: really bad
vikstar: cause the shapes
vikstar: were designed
vikstar: so that you would
vikstar: fit in them
vikstar: if you were at the bottom
vikstar: yeah
vikstar: so it was like
vikstar: just a slight mess up
vikstar: really
simon: so it's like
simon: if I'm meant to
simon: stand like this
simon: the head piece
simon: because it's moved up
simon: because of that
simon: is now here
simon: so I have to awkwardly
simon: try and jump
simon: yeah
vikstar: and if we were trying to
vikstar: do it seriously
vikstar: we would have said
vikstar: this is not going to work
vikstar: we can't compete
vikstar: in this game
vikstar: but instead
vikstar: we literally just got
vikstar: knocked in
vikstar: and just failed
vikstar: everything
vikstar: it was a better video
vikstar: you see where
simon: mine is
simon: how it's
simon: I'm meant to be
simon: that's meant to be
simon: on the
Unknown: floor
vikstar: yeah
simon: but obviously
simon: it's like a yard above
vikstar: that one worked out
vikstar: better
simon: it hit me square in the
Unknown: head
Unknown: you
simon: were freezing
randolph: in the
simon: video
simon: Josh
vikstar: had a win
vikstar: yeah
vikstar: Josh had W host
simon: to be fair though
simon: he actually really
simon: wanted to do
Unknown: it
simon: hole in the wall
simon: is the one that he
Unknown: was
simon: wanting
simon: he was like
simon: hole in the wall
simon: be sick
simon: like it's one
simon: he could have
vikstar: got a
Unknown: guest
simon: to
vikstar: host it
vikstar: he didn't want that wall
simon: true
simon: that was freezing
vikstar: I
Unknown: see
Unknown: do
simon: you prefer the
simon: big shoots
simon: or
Unknown: like
simon: the smaller shoots
simon: because me and Josh
simon: realised
Unknown: the
simon: holiday videos
simon: both of them
simon: the two biggest videos
simon: neither of them
simon: we had a cameraman
Unknown: yeah
vikstar: even the
simon: Europe one
simon: we went to Benidorm
vikstar: we
simon: had a security guard
simon: and that was
randolph: it
randolph: mad
vikstar: mad
vikstar: so
simon: John's out of a
Unknown: job
vikstar: two questions there
vikstar: I guess
vikstar: I prefer
vikstar: the more loosely formatted videos
vikstar: my favourite videos
vikstar: are like the travelling ones
vikstar: where you get to do stuff
vikstar: you just go
vikstar: go with the flow
Unknown: I
vikstar: don't think it
vikstar: makes a difference
vikstar: whether we have
vikstar: camera people
vikstar: or cameras ourselves
vikstar: because I think
vikstar: we're now at the point
Unknown: where
Unknown: it's
vikstar: we'll miss things
vikstar: if we're having to
vikstar: vlog it ourselves
vikstar: because we
Unknown: just
vikstar: don't have that same
vikstar: mindset
simon: I think
vikstar: it's good
vikstar: to have a combo of both
vikstar: but it's also really nice
Unknown: there
vikstar: are some things
vikstar: like for
Unknown: example
vikstar: in the Europe calories
Unknown: video
Unknown: me,
vikstar: Harry and Lana
vikstar: literally sprinting
vikstar: to try and find out
vikstar: where this hot air balloon
vikstar: is landing
vikstar: we would have struggled
vikstar: to vlog that
vikstar: kind of thing
vikstar: so it's nice
vikstar: sometimes just knowing
vikstar: that you can do
vikstar: what you do
vikstar: and I feel like
vikstar: you actually get better content
Unknown: for
vikstar: having it shot for you
Unknown: John
vikstar: there we go
vikstar: John celebrates
vikstar: camera
vikstar: so
vikstar: yeah
Unknown: that's
vikstar: I prefer having cameras
vikstar: and
vikstar: my favourites
vikstar: yeah
vikstar: they're going out there
vikstar: I'm stressed by
vikstar: big studio videos
randolph: because I've
vikstar: had
vikstar: two
vikstar: two big ones
vikstar: that I've been
vikstar: partial organiser of
vikstar: yeah
vikstar: so MrBeast
randolph: yeah
randolph: and
vikstar: then
vikstar: next week's
vikstar: next week's video
vikstar: is a big one
vikstar: yeah
vikstar: so
vikstar: maybe
vikstar: maybe let's chill out
vikstar: for a
Unknown: bit
randolph: yeah I remember Ethan
randolph: was really stressed
randolph: as well for the
randolph: the escape rooms
randolph: right
vikstar: yeah that was a tough one
vikstar: yeah because he couldn't
vikstar: see them
Unknown: right
vikstar: so it's like
randolph: a combination
randolph: of like
Unknown: yeah
vikstar: he can
randolph: organise them
randolph: but he can't actually
randolph: see them
randolph: because he doesn't know
randolph: the answer
Unknown: at
vikstar: the same time
vikstar: I feel like
vikstar: the easy solution
vikstar: to that
vikstar: is just
vikstar: be a host
vikstar: be a host
vikstar: know exactly
vikstar: what the things are
vikstar: and
randolph: just
vikstar: put someone else
vikstar: into play
vikstar: but
vikstar: I feel like it's easy
vikstar: to miss
vikstar: obviously
vikstar: when you're making videos
simon: yeah
simon: I think
simon: next week's video
Unknown: the
simon: big shoot
simon: you were talking about
simon: yeah
simon: I think that's my favourite
simon: big shoot we've
Unknown: done
Unknown: in
simon: terms of
Unknown: video
vikstar: interesting
simon: like I think
simon: the MrBeast one
simon: was a lot of fun
Unknown: but
Unknown: it
vikstar: wasn't sight
vikstar: it was
vikstar: it was spectacle
vikstar: but not sight
vikstar: yeah
simon: yeah
simon: I left it thinking
simon: there wasn't much personality
simon: of us in
Unknown: there
simon: and
simon: whereas this one I left
simon: and I was like
simon: this one
Unknown: was
simon: it was good
simon: like really really good
vikstar: very us
simon: yeah
simon: I think it's like
simon: the perfect combination
simon: of
Unknown: like
simon: us
Unknown: and
simon: production
vikstar: yeah
vikstar: I agree
simon: so yeah
simon: this week's video
Unknown: banger
vikstar: sick
vikstar: there we go
vikstar: watch it be
simon: a 9 out of 10
vikstar: yeah honestly
vikstar: that's the way the game goes
vikstar: it's
randolph: literally the way
randolph: exactly the way it goes
randolph: um
randolph: but yeah I think
randolph: oh what's
Unknown: this
randolph: aw
randolph: culture
simon: 92
simon: million
simon: that's crazy
Unknown: I
simon: think
simon: I think that as well
simon: that one
Unknown: is
simon: that's the perfect video
Unknown: in
simon: terms of
simon: that's
Unknown: it
simon: like
Unknown: we
simon: were on the bad team
simon: but
simon: it was so fun
randolph: yeah
Unknown: and
simon: the good team
simon: obviously just had like
simon: an amazing
Unknown: time
Unknown: because
simon: I know the first one
simon: where you were in London
simon: like
Unknown: as
simon: much as you mentioned
simon: the bad team
simon: yeah
simon: we didn't actually
vikstar: do anything
simon: yeah
simon: and I don't think you had
simon: that much fun
simon: that you were
Unknown: like
Unknown: and
vikstar: the secret ingredient
vikstar: is alcohol
vikstar: every Sidemen video
vikstar: is better
randolph: yeah
randolph: there's alcohol
vikstar: involved
vikstar: true
vikstar: which is the one
randolph: oh the
randolph: you
randolph: neither of you
randolph: were there
randolph: the cube
Unknown: yeah
vikstar: exactly
vikstar: that was
randolph: so bad
randolph: and then we just
Unknown: got
randolph: like
randolph: tasting it was so good
vikstar: you know I organised
vikstar: that whole video
vikstar: yeah
vikstar: and
vikstar: because JJ didn't like the shoot
vikstar: he had me
vikstar: take a yellow card
vikstar: and only get half the video
vikstar: I enjoyed that video
randolph: I literally
randolph: I can't say anything
randolph: I wasn't there
randolph: I think it was because
randolph: they were like
randolph: ask Vick about the thumbnail
randolph: he hasn't replied
Unknown: I had Covid
Unknown: yeah
vikstar: that was an incredible video
vikstar: to be fair
vikstar: it didn't do very well though
vikstar: to be fair
vikstar: I remember watching
simon: this video
simon: and thinking
Unknown: no
simon: one wants to be
simon: no
vikstar: I laughed
vikstar: I laughed more than
vikstar: like other videos
vikstar: it is
Unknown: there
simon: were five people
vikstar: yeah
vikstar: Stephen Trice
vikstar: is the secret source
Unknown: also
simon: well now we know as well
simon: that we actually can
Unknown: miss
simon: like
simon: multiple people
randolph: yeah
randolph: as in
simon: like
simon: we've done shoots now
Unknown: where
simon: three of us are
Unknown: missing
Unknown: true
randolph: true
Unknown: true
Unknown: so
simon: I
Unknown: think
Unknown: as
simon: much as it does
simon: kind of take away
simon: from the Sidemen
Unknown: it's
simon: it's more of like
simon: okay
simon: there's proof
simon: that there's longevity
vikstar: yeah
simon: because before
simon: we were like
simon: okay if one Sideman's gone
vikstar: it's done
vikstar: the house of cards collapses
vikstar: yeah yeah
vikstar: yeah
simon: obviously JJ was missing
simon: Ethan was missing
simon: you've been missing
simon: we all
Unknown: had
simon: Covid
simon: missed some
Unknown: so yeah
simon: we can
Unknown: we
simon: can prove we can survive
Unknown: I
randolph: will survive
Unknown: nice
simon: nice
simon: oh is this you trying to
simon: step over it bro
simon: you were so bad
simon: yes
vikstar: oh my
vikstar: well I was drunk
vikstar: and blind
vikstar: look how replayed that
vikstar: that next clip is
vikstar: by the
Unknown: way
Unknown: I'm
randolph: really disappointed
randolph: this is the last
vikstar: one
vikstar: when you jump
vikstar: jump isn't it
randolph: they take them off
Unknown: yeah
randolph: oh okay
randolph: that's that one
vikstar: no no
vikstar: it's the clip where they put it
vikstar: they put it up
vikstar: this clip here
vikstar: yeah
vikstar: this actually finished me
vikstar: it's this one
Unknown: it's this one
randolph: did you know
randolph: no
simon: because I felt like
simon: you
randolph: could have heard them
randolph: bro I had no idea
randolph: bro
Unknown: I'm
Unknown: I'm
randolph: absolutely
Unknown: pissed
simon: it's the fact right
simon: you've got nothing
Unknown: and
simon: you somehow
simon: walked into the wall
Unknown: bro
randolph: I actually
randolph: like that
randolph: that's why you can't write it
randolph: and it just works
randolph: you can't yeah
randolph: after that first death as well
randolph: in my head I was really happy
randolph: I was like wow
randolph: I've smashed that
randolph: yeah
simon: yeah
simon: that was so
Unknown: good
randolph: it was like a shambles of a shoot though
randolph: because everyone was just like giddy
randolph: you know what I'm saying
randolph: that's good though
randolph: that's good
randolph: yeah it helped
randolph: it helped
randolph: it
Unknown: helped
randolph: yeah there's four of the boys
randolph: me and then Stephen
randolph: I also said at the time
randolph: on the podcast when we filmed that one
randolph: I was really angry right
randolph: because
Unknown: like
randolph: whoever the camera people were
randolph: I know who they were
randolph: but I won't say
randolph: they had like wide angle lenses right
randolph: bare wide
simon: and
randolph: like they
Unknown: would
randolph: smoosh us together all the time
randolph: so all
randolph: there's not many of us right
randolph: and we're always like
randolph: me and JJ and Toby
randolph: we're like literally like
randolph: sideways on
randolph: and like together
randolph: and they're like oh guys
randolph: can you squish in
randolph: and I'm like
randolph: how about you walk back
randolph: like please
randolph: like walk back
randolph: and you'll fit us in
randolph: bro
randolph: because
randolph: just pull it up
randolph: just go to any shop
randolph: where we're all
randolph: like that's not bad
randolph: we find us all together
randolph: in stages
randolph: where
simon: they're against the wall
simon: yeah I think it's earlier
randolph: on
randolph: it's earlier on
randolph: one of the first
Unknown: ones
randolph: Randy's onto
Unknown: it
Unknown: look
vikstar: at that
vikstar: even that
vikstar: look at JJ standing
vikstar: and Ethan
vikstar: that is very uncomfortable
randolph: and there's more examples
randolph: but go back a bit earlier on
Unknown: perhaps
randolph: yeah that one
randolph: that one
randolph: John's coming
vikstar: not John
vikstar: Randy's coming
randolph: for your job
randolph: yeah
randolph: get
vikstar: Randy on
randolph: the land
randolph: as long as it's funny
Unknown: man
simon: it's so
Unknown: squished
randolph: it's obvious
randolph: I'm being over dramatic
randolph: of course
randolph: but
Unknown: like
randolph: they could have walked back
randolph: it's cute
vikstar: though
vikstar: it's intimate
vikstar: it was nice
vikstar: the energy is
randolph: condensed
randolph: but I'm thinking
randolph: say you didn't have Covid
randolph: like all of you boys
randolph: didn't have Covid
randolph: is the video fucked now
randolph: because there's more of you
randolph: they can't fit in
Unknown: frame
Unknown: true
randolph: but yeah
randolph: anyway
randolph: I'm conscious you guys
randolph: have got some filming
Unknown: we
