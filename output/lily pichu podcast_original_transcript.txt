Unknown: the
SPEAKER_01: only ex-tri-guy.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so I'm not too familiar with tri-
SPEAKER_02: Okay, do you know the tri-
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: It's like a
SPEAKER_01: cheater trauma.
SPEAKER_02: Cheater tri-guy.
SPEAKER_02: And you know how I feel about
SPEAKER_01: cheaters.
Unknown: Yeah, why
SPEAKER_01: are you looking at me, man?
SPEAKER_01: And I didn't put it on the list of topics.
Unknown: Clock it.
SPEAKER_01: But, do you recall what happened?
SPEAKER_01: He cheated on her.
SPEAKER_01: So-
SPEAKER_01: Like someone younger?
Unknown: Dude,
SPEAKER_01: you details.
SPEAKER_01: One, apparently, his personality publicly
SPEAKER_01: was essentially
Unknown: loving
SPEAKER_01: his wife.
SPEAKER_01: Like his wife was his personality.
SPEAKER_01: Right, I remember this.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Holy shit.
SPEAKER_01: Or like his brand, let's say.
SPEAKER_01: Two, he did cheat, I believe, with someone younger.
SPEAKER_01: But three, she worked at the company
Unknown: under
SPEAKER_01: him.
Unknown: And
SPEAKER_01: four, they also cheated in public.
SPEAKER_02: Wow.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, okay, I remember.

SPEAKER_01: So after three years, he's back on the internet
Unknown: and
SPEAKER_01: the first
Unknown: episode
SPEAKER_01: of his podcast
Unknown: is
SPEAKER_01: with
Unknown: his
SPEAKER_01: wife.
SPEAKER_01: Here was my confusion.
SPEAKER_01: I thought they stayed together,
Unknown: but
SPEAKER_01: she said ex-wife, could we get some clarity?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so a lot of people thought they were together,
SPEAKER_00: but it turns out they have been separated for a while.
SPEAKER_01: Well, that was my guess.
Unknown: Fuck,
SPEAKER_01: here's the thing.
SPEAKER_01: We could still do it and I think we'll do it better.
SPEAKER_01: I initially, I think me and many, many, many others
SPEAKER_01: were initially put off by this
Unknown: idea
SPEAKER_01: and the clips that I saw and everything
SPEAKER_01: because I thought they were still together.
Unknown: But
SPEAKER_01: now that I know that they're not, I'm like, oh, few.
SPEAKER_01: Now it's a lot less weird and it actually kind of makes sense.
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_01: see.
Unknown: Wait,
SPEAKER_01: so why, how, wait, how was it though?
Unknown: Like,
SPEAKER_01: how did it
Unknown: go,
SPEAKER_01: like?
SPEAKER_01: Girl, it was fucking awkward.
SPEAKER_01: It was really-
SPEAKER_01: The vibes were off?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it was just
Unknown: her saying
SPEAKER_01: she really, really, really
SPEAKER_01: doesn't forgive him, understandably so.
SPEAKER_01: Then my guess talking about like trying to co-parent,
SPEAKER_01: mind you, I have not seen the full podcast,
SPEAKER_01: so I'd love to hear from Alvia or anyone who has.
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_01: just watch clips on TikTok,
Unknown: but
SPEAKER_01: it's a little bit
Unknown: odd
SPEAKER_01: because they're not doing this from the perspective of like,
Unknown: it
SPEAKER_01: seems like they've both gone through this
Unknown: thing
SPEAKER_01: together
SPEAKER_01: and understand and like feel okay being around each other.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, sense the tension
Unknown: and
SPEAKER_01: the dynamic feels
Unknown: weird.
Unknown: And
SPEAKER_01: he looks and sounds like a dog
SPEAKER_01: with his tail tucked behind his legs.
Unknown: And
SPEAKER_01: she, I think, to me, it kind of felt like she was
SPEAKER_01: coming from the perspective of someone
Unknown: who
SPEAKER_01: has been kind of shamed and ridiculed publicly.
Unknown: And
SPEAKER_01: this feels like likely her only opportunity to be like,
SPEAKER_01: just so you guys know,
SPEAKER_01: I'm really not okay with what happened.
Unknown: And
SPEAKER_01: even though it was three years ago,
Unknown: and
SPEAKER_01: I'm not saying like she should be more over it
SPEAKER_01: or something,
Unknown: to
SPEAKER_01: me, it kind of felt like
Unknown: the
SPEAKER_01: cumulate.
SPEAKER_02: What's that word again?
SPEAKER_02: Cumulation.
Unknown: That's
SPEAKER_01: what I was
SPEAKER_02: gonna
SPEAKER_01: say,
SPEAKER_01: but it just
Unknown: didn't
SPEAKER_01: sound right.
SPEAKER_01: Accumulated.
SPEAKER_01: The cumulation.
SPEAKER_01: It culminated
Unknown: into.
SPEAKER_01: It
Unknown: just
SPEAKER_01: felt like the culmination.
SPEAKER_01: Culmination.
SPEAKER_01: Is that not it?
SPEAKER_01: Whatever.
SPEAKER_01: Of all of the stuff she went through.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, culmination.
SPEAKER_01: Let's go.
SPEAKER_01: Like all the pain and resentment she had for him
SPEAKER_01: and then kind of like
Unknown: letting
SPEAKER_01: that out publicly.
SPEAKER_01: So it's cathartic.
SPEAKER_01: Not cathartic.
SPEAKER_01: I hope it was cathartic for her.
SPEAKER_01: Wow.
SPEAKER_01: But I will say it was like a little uncomfortable
Unknown: to
SPEAKER_01: see clips of.
SPEAKER_01: It just gives you this uneasy feeling.
SPEAKER_01: Understandably so, it's a tough topic,
SPEAKER_01: but
SPEAKER_02: I'd
SPEAKER_01: love to hear your thoughts
SPEAKER_01: and I'd love to get more information from stuff.
SPEAKER_01: I feel
SPEAKER_02: like things like that work
SPEAKER_02: if both people are like moved on.
SPEAKER_02: And I think that could make a fire podcast
SPEAKER_02: I think so too.
Unknown: If
SPEAKER_02: you're so past it that you can reflect maturely
SPEAKER_02: and there's no tension, no hard feelings.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's a
Unknown: cool concept,
SPEAKER_02: honestly,
SPEAKER_02: to see two people who have moved on.
SPEAKER_02: But it's like, if there's still tension,
SPEAKER_02: I can't even imagine what that must be like listening to it.
Unknown: Would
SPEAKER_02: you ever do a podcast with your ex?
SPEAKER_02: Like if you've
Unknown: fully
SPEAKER_02: moved on,
SPEAKER_02: like is that something you would ever do?
SPEAKER_02: I
SPEAKER_01: would like
Unknown: to
SPEAKER_01: put on the record
SPEAKER_01: that I don't have any exes.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: If a man ever claims to have known me, he's lying.
SPEAKER_01: I like that.
SPEAKER_01: I
Unknown: don't
SPEAKER_01: know him
SPEAKER_01: and I don't know who you're talking about, period.
SPEAKER_01: Him, they, that plural single, I don't know
Unknown: any
SPEAKER_01: of
Unknown: them.
Unknown: How
SPEAKER_01: about you?
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_01: don't really, I'd
Unknown: be
SPEAKER_01: down.
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_01: think
Unknown: because
SPEAKER_01: I know you so well,
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_01: know for you.
SPEAKER_01: I mean,
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_01: feel like the podcast that you would do with an ex
Unknown: would
SPEAKER_01: be a lot more comfortable and entertaining
SPEAKER_01: and enjoyable to watch from an audience's perspective.
SPEAKER_01: It'd be chill.
SPEAKER_01: This
Unknown: felt
SPEAKER_01: like watching two people
SPEAKER_01: in the middle of a breakup.
Unknown: You
SPEAKER_01: know, she's like,
SPEAKER_01: I'm gonna hate this about you, I fuck you.
SPEAKER_01: Like I'm not saying she shouldn't.
SPEAKER_01: I'm not saying she shouldn't.
SPEAKER_01: I see.
SPEAKER_01: I also, to be completely honest with you,
SPEAKER_01: I got the impression that he primarily did this
SPEAKER_01: because he felt like
Unknown: from
SPEAKER_01: a PR or public
SPEAKER_01: or optics perspective,
Unknown: it
SPEAKER_01: wouldn't be acceptable for him to come back
SPEAKER_01: to the internet, start making content again.
SPEAKER_01: Unless this was like the first episode
SPEAKER_01: or unless it was
Unknown: addressed
SPEAKER_01: in a manner
SPEAKER_01: that
Unknown: was
SPEAKER_01: nice to the wife, if that makes sense.
Unknown: That
SPEAKER_01: was really the impression I got.
SPEAKER_01: It wasn't like, oh, he's coming to this.
SPEAKER_01: He has an opinion.
Unknown: I'm
SPEAKER_01: not saying he does not have an opinion
SPEAKER_01: or hasn't reflected.
SPEAKER_01: Again, I haven't watched the full thing,
SPEAKER_01: but from the clips I saw,
Unknown: it
SPEAKER_01: almost was like just watching someone publicly be
Unknown: punished
SPEAKER_01: in a way.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it was odd.
SPEAKER_01: It seems that people are very like,
SPEAKER_02: I mean, they're obviously for Ariel,
SPEAKER_02: but like, he just looks a little,
SPEAKER_02: not pathetic,
SPEAKER_01: but you know what I mean, like very
Unknown: weak.
SPEAKER_01: That's what I
Unknown: mean.
SPEAKER_01: In a way, I'm kind of just like,
SPEAKER_01: what was the purpose of this,
SPEAKER_01: aside from like trying to exonerate yourself to an extent
Unknown: that
SPEAKER_01: you feel comfortable posting online again,
Unknown: but
SPEAKER_01: I also feel like it just
Unknown: does
SPEAKER_01: quite a fair bit
SPEAKER_01: of
Unknown: damage
SPEAKER_01: in the same breath.
SPEAKER_01: I don't
SPEAKER_03: know.
Unknown: Yeah,
SPEAKER_01: people are not nice.
SPEAKER_01: I'm reading like some, you know, reactions.
Unknown: If
SPEAKER_01: I was him, I wouldn't have done this
SPEAKER_01: unless it felt like
Unknown: his
SPEAKER_01: relationship with her
SPEAKER_01: was in a good enough
Unknown: spot
SPEAKER_01: to publicize, to be honest.
SPEAKER_01: So, like,
SPEAKER_02: his thing was that he's a loving husband
Unknown: and
SPEAKER_02: he cheats on her with
Unknown: the
SPEAKER_02: head of HR
SPEAKER_02: under his
Unknown: company.
SPEAKER_02: Dude, dude, like, what?
SPEAKER_02: Like, such bad decisions.
SPEAKER_02: Wow.
SPEAKER_02: Yep.
SPEAKER_02: I'm sorry, just baffling.
SPEAKER_02: Like,
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_02: don't agree with you.
SPEAKER_01: Like, in your own company.
SPEAKER_01: You know that saying?
SPEAKER_01: What?
SPEAKER_01: Reality is oftentimes stranger than fiction.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, my God, it reminds me of the fucking,
SPEAKER_01: who's that?
SPEAKER_01: The CEO.
SPEAKER_01: You're saying?
SPEAKER_01: They're like, they're so crazy.
SPEAKER_02: The audacity to
SPEAKER_01: be doing this in
SPEAKER_02: public.
SPEAKER_01: The goal.
SPEAKER_01: We clap.
SPEAKER_01: The goal.
SPEAKER_01: The goal.
SPEAKER_01: We clap.
SPEAKER_01: TwitchCon.
Unknown: Are
SPEAKER_01: we not going anymore?
SPEAKER_01: Are we still going?
SPEAKER_01: I have
SPEAKER_02: an artist alley-biss,
Unknown: and
SPEAKER_02: we have all this stuff.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's like, I have to go.
SPEAKER_02: I might cancel my meeting here.
SPEAKER_02: I haven't told them yet, but I might do that,
SPEAKER_02: because I think a lot of people are not,
Unknown: you
SPEAKER_02: know.
SPEAKER_02: In the mood.
SPEAKER_02: I'm just not in the mood to meet people lately.
SPEAKER_02: Fair enough.
SPEAKER_02: I heard Ray and Cutie are not going,
SPEAKER_02: and they canceled there.
SPEAKER_02: When Ray told
SPEAKER_01: me that, that's actually
SPEAKER_02: what?
SPEAKER_01: You messaged me after.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it concerned me enough to be like,
SPEAKER_01: should we be concerned?
SPEAKER_01: They're concerned?
SPEAKER_02: We were going to do like it,
Unknown: not
SPEAKER_01: in person, but like
SPEAKER_02: it in person,
SPEAKER_02: but we decided not to
SPEAKER_01: do it either, so.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know, it's just
Unknown: kind of
SPEAKER_02: freaky,
SPEAKER_01: scary
Unknown: these
SPEAKER_01: days.
SPEAKER_01: I completely agree, and it's a tough situation
SPEAKER_01: where
Unknown: classic
SPEAKER_01: case of like,
Unknown: one
SPEAKER_01: bad apple
Unknown: ruins
SPEAKER_01: the bunch.
SPEAKER_01: I know.
SPEAKER_01: That's all it takes.
SPEAKER_01: And it always makes me think back to Christina Grimmie,
SPEAKER_01: where it's like, me too.
SPEAKER_01: It really just takes one really bad encounter.
SPEAKER_02: That's the one.
SPEAKER_02: You never know.
SPEAKER_02: That like still like affects me.
SPEAKER_02: Like she
SPEAKER_01: was so
SPEAKER_02: young too, 22, 23.
SPEAKER_02: She was just meeting her fans after a concert.
Unknown: Ooh,
SPEAKER_01: okay.
SPEAKER_01: It's a really dark tale to recall,
SPEAKER_01: but
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_01: think it's worth recalling since we're on this topic,
Unknown: and
SPEAKER_01: especially because I recently went down
SPEAKER_01: this rabbit hole regarding Christina Grimmie's passing,
SPEAKER_01: because
Unknown: apparently,
SPEAKER_01: Glimpse of Us by Joji,
SPEAKER_01: the original writers wrote that song for her.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah,
SPEAKER_01: which
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_01: was shocked to learn.
SPEAKER_01: And then that song was passed on to Joji,
SPEAKER_01: and he rewrote it a little bit,
SPEAKER_01: and then it became less,
SPEAKER_01: like it became more so about
Unknown: missing
SPEAKER_01: a romantic interest
SPEAKER_01: when you're with another one,
Unknown: but
SPEAKER_01: initially the writers wrote it
SPEAKER_01: because
Unknown: they
SPEAKER_01: were really good friends with Christina Grimmie
SPEAKER_01: and simply missed her and just wanted to
Unknown: find
SPEAKER_01: a glimpse
SPEAKER_01: of her in everyday things.
Unknown: But
SPEAKER_01: anyways,
Unknown: when
SPEAKER_01: I saw that,
SPEAKER_01: because I was initially looking up the song,
SPEAKER_01: and then I realized it was relating to her,
SPEAKER_01: and then okay, I went down this rabbit hole
SPEAKER_01: where
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_01: relearned about what happened.
Unknown: Do
SPEAKER_01: you recall the story?
SPEAKER_01: She was, he was in line, right?
SPEAKER_01: So she did a meet and greet, I believe,
SPEAKER_01: after one of her shows,
SPEAKER_01: and there was this like crazy discord stalker that she had,
SPEAKER_01: and he was in line to meet her,
Unknown: and he
SPEAKER_01: got to the front of the line,
Unknown: and
SPEAKER_01: he was acting kind of like
Unknown: awkward
SPEAKER_01: or weird,
Unknown: and
SPEAKER_01: she opened her arms up to go hug him,
SPEAKER_01: and that's when he shot her.
SPEAKER_01: Is that not the saddest, craziest thing you've ever heard?
SPEAKER_01: It sends a shiver down my spine.
SPEAKER_01: Imagine
Unknown: how
SPEAKER_01: kind and selfless and sweet of a person she was
Unknown: to
SPEAKER_01: see maybe like
Unknown: a
SPEAKER_01: stumbling, awkward fan,
SPEAKER_01: and like to open her arms up
Unknown: to
SPEAKER_01: him.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and then her brother tried to intervene,
Unknown: and
SPEAKER_01: even for her brother that must have been so traumatic,
SPEAKER_01: and it makes me so sad because if you guys know me,
SPEAKER_01: and you know I've been making content for years,
SPEAKER_01: anytime someone recognizes me or I meet a fan,
SPEAKER_01: like genuinely nothing makes me happier.
SPEAKER_01: I feel like
Unknown: that's
SPEAKER_01: what makes me feel connected
SPEAKER_01: to this social media stuff that we do,
SPEAKER_01: actually meeting you guys in person,
SPEAKER_01: and so I love those
Unknown: organic
SPEAKER_01: moments, but over the years,
Unknown: and
SPEAKER_01: luckily I haven't had any like
Unknown: crazy
SPEAKER_01: bad
SPEAKER_01: in-person interactions, but I have had some weird ones.
Unknown: It
SPEAKER_01: just gets to a point where you're like,
SPEAKER_02: sometimes it's actually
Unknown: that
SPEAKER_01: too,
SPEAKER_01: and sometimes
Unknown: it's
SPEAKER_01: nicer to just meet people organically
SPEAKER_01: than like
Unknown: organized
SPEAKER_01: meetings where if someone
SPEAKER_01: that did want to know where you were, they would know.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I don't think
SPEAKER_01: I'm gonna cancel
Unknown: my video.
Unknown: Sorry,
SPEAKER_01: I don't mean to scare you.
SPEAKER_01: And again, TwitchCon does tend to be,
SPEAKER_01: yeah,
Unknown: that's not
SPEAKER_01: what you think it is.
SPEAKER_01: TwitchCon does tend to be really safe,
SPEAKER_01: and I think they have security,
SPEAKER_01: I think they have metal detectors, et cetera.
Unknown: But
SPEAKER_01: honestly, the other time, sorry,
SPEAKER_01: but you just never know for sure,
SPEAKER_01: and if you don't feel comfortable,
SPEAKER_01: you don't feel comfortable.
SPEAKER_01: And I think that's how
Unknown: QD,
SPEAKER_01: Ray,
SPEAKER_01: you and I sort of all feel right now.
Unknown: The
SPEAKER_01: other time that I sort of felt this way
SPEAKER_01: was when I had been really outspoken
SPEAKER_01: against gambling on Twitch, do you remember?
SPEAKER_01: And it turned into this huge fiasco online,
SPEAKER_01: which I did not think it would,
SPEAKER_01: and I,
Unknown: in
SPEAKER_01: a way I didn't even care that much,
SPEAKER_01: I was just expressing my opinion,
SPEAKER_01: but the amount of vitriol and harassment
SPEAKER_01: that I was getting at that time,
SPEAKER_01: I don't think I explicitly said this at the time,
SPEAKER_01: but that was the reason I didn't go to TwitchCon either,
Unknown: because
SPEAKER_01: it was like a month or two.
SPEAKER_01: Because she said gambling
SPEAKER_02: is bad
SPEAKER_02: and shouldn't be on Twitch, by the way.
SPEAKER_01: Crypto gambling
SPEAKER_02: should not be advertised on Twitch.
SPEAKER_01: In particular, and
Unknown: dude,
SPEAKER_01: no, like it's scared me.
SPEAKER_01: The kinds of things that people were sending me on Twitter.
SPEAKER_01: No, I bet
SPEAKER_02: you, I
SPEAKER_01: scared me so much.
SPEAKER_01: I was like, I'm sorry, I'm not comfortable
SPEAKER_01: putting myself in a position where
Unknown: people
SPEAKER_01: can find me.
SPEAKER_02: I feel like
Unknown: that
SPEAKER_02: is encouraged on Twitter,
SPEAKER_02: especially now, like now more than ever,
Unknown: do
SPEAKER_02: I see
Unknown: so
SPEAKER_02: much like
Unknown: violence
SPEAKER_02: and just ugliness?
Unknown: Just
SPEAKER_02: so much, like you fucking posted
SPEAKER_02: a picture of yourself with that
SPEAKER_02: on your fucking brother's wedding background.
SPEAKER_02: So many things to
Unknown: say.
SPEAKER_02: I feel like it's just so encouraged, you know?
SPEAKER_02: There's this crazy, like what are you doing?
SPEAKER_02: All you said was crypto gambling is bad guys,
SPEAKER_02: and it just, how can we make this about Pokemains a bitch?
SPEAKER_02: How can we quit this
Unknown: in
SPEAKER_02: a way that makes her evil?
SPEAKER_02: Like I swear to God,
SPEAKER_02: that's like some people's full-time jobs,
SPEAKER_02: like she'll post anything,
SPEAKER_02: how can we spin this around?
SPEAKER_02: So Pokemains is the bad guy here.
SPEAKER_02: Every time I think about like this shit she gets,
SPEAKER_02: my brain like fucking explodes.
SPEAKER_02: This is like my biggest defender.
SPEAKER_02: She's just going on her fucking stage, I love it.
SPEAKER_02: But when you do that,
SPEAKER_02: you also like drown out legitimate criticism
SPEAKER_02: if there even is
SPEAKER_01: any.
SPEAKER_01: And I'm like, girl,
SPEAKER_01: there's legitimate criticism for everyone,
SPEAKER_01: including myself.
SPEAKER_01: But Pokemains is a bitch.
SPEAKER_01: How dare you post the photo in the back of your drug, girl.
SPEAKER_01: Sorry, it's just
SPEAKER_02: so fucking annoying.
SPEAKER_02: I think people are just, you know, naturally,
SPEAKER_02: just some people are just hateful like that,
SPEAKER_02: like
Unknown: there
SPEAKER_02: was a clip of me, for example,
SPEAKER_02: and then
Unknown: all
SPEAKER_02: immediately, oh no, no, no, no.
Unknown: There
SPEAKER_02: was a picture of me and like kind of Emily,
SPEAKER_02: like just three of us.
Unknown: They're
SPEAKER_02: like,
SPEAKER_01: oh yeah,
SPEAKER_02: these three ugly,
SPEAKER_01: worthless,
SPEAKER_01: like fucking streamer girl,
SPEAKER_01: like they don't
SPEAKER_02: do anything.
SPEAKER_02: It's just like immediate assumption about,
SPEAKER_02: because you're a girl and you do influence.
SPEAKER_02: Sometimes
SPEAKER_01: I see comments like, are you
SPEAKER_02: okay?
SPEAKER_01: Are you like seriously, are you okay?
SPEAKER_01: Why do you hate
Unknown: women
SPEAKER_01: that much?
SPEAKER_01: I just, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: Why is your, imagine seeing three beautiful,
SPEAKER_01: young, pretty girls
Unknown: hanging
SPEAKER_01: out,
SPEAKER_01: minding their business,
SPEAKER_01: and that's your first thought,
SPEAKER_01: just like derailing into this.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know if it's crazy to say,
SPEAKER_01: but like sometimes I feel like there is like a Twitter induced,
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_01: don't want to say like schizophrenia,
SPEAKER_01: but like mental disassociation of sorts.
SPEAKER_01: Like
Unknown: some
SPEAKER_01: of those people are,
SPEAKER_01: it's certainly more hateful nowadays, but,
SPEAKER_01: and
Unknown: it's
SPEAKER_01: okay.
SPEAKER_01: I hate to.
SPEAKER_01: What are you gonna do?
SPEAKER_01: Also
Unknown: bring
SPEAKER_01: this up, but yeah,
SPEAKER_01: evidently this all also relates to
Unknown: the
SPEAKER_01: recent,
SPEAKER_01: I don't even know.
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_01: hate saying like
Unknown: death
SPEAKER_01: shooting,
SPEAKER_01: all such sad words
Unknown: of Charlie
SPEAKER_01: Kirk,
SPEAKER_01: which is just another reminder of how unsafe it can be
Unknown: to
SPEAKER_01: be a public figure and to
Unknown: have
SPEAKER_01: people
SPEAKER_01: be able to readily find you.
Unknown: You're
SPEAKER_01: always gonna have people who don't like you.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but most people,
SPEAKER_02: if you don't like someone, you turn it off
Unknown: and
SPEAKER_02: then you move on to something else.
SPEAKER_01: And most people
Unknown: don't
SPEAKER_01: have,
Unknown: maybe,
SPEAKER_01: well, you're not going to go into gun ownership in America?
SPEAKER_01: No, not really because I'm Canadian.
SPEAKER_01: So
Unknown: sometimes
SPEAKER_01: I hear about
Unknown: the
SPEAKER_01: gun ownership issues
SPEAKER_01: and I'm like, what's going on here?
SPEAKER_01: Wait, why do we need snipers?
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_01: also don't think gun ownership,
SPEAKER_01: like I think it deserves a nuanced approach.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, evidently I'm
SPEAKER_01: not like,
SPEAKER_01: no guns ever forever all the time.
SPEAKER_01: But
Unknown: it
SPEAKER_01: is regulation.
Unknown: That
SPEAKER_02: you're Canadian because on Twitter
SPEAKER_02: I saw such a funny exchange.
SPEAKER_02: There was someone arguing like,
Unknown: yeah, what the fuck
SPEAKER_01: is
SPEAKER_02: America's ball of oil?
SPEAKER_02: They were very outspoken.
SPEAKER_02: And then some Twitter person replied like,
SPEAKER_02: oh my God, you know, fuck you.
SPEAKER_02: If you don't like it, get out of our country.
SPEAKER_02: And they're like, I'm Canadian.
SPEAKER_02: It's always the Canadians that are like...
SPEAKER_02: Girl, exactly.
SPEAKER_02: It's so funny because they have no rebuttal.
SPEAKER_02: Like I got no steak in your country.
SPEAKER_02: Like I'm not even not in your country.
SPEAKER_02: I don't give a fuck.
SPEAKER_02: I'm
SPEAKER_01: just saying
SPEAKER_02: what I want to think,
SPEAKER_01: right?
SPEAKER_01: It's interesting that that is always
SPEAKER_01: the immediate...
SPEAKER_01: Get out of our country.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, I actually once tweeted something
SPEAKER_01: which I swiftly deleted,
Unknown: where
SPEAKER_01: I got a lot of responses like that.
SPEAKER_01: And the odd thing is like, what did you tweet?
SPEAKER_01: I get out of the country all the
Unknown: time.
SPEAKER_03: You're not even from America.
SPEAKER_03: I'm
SPEAKER_01: not from here.
SPEAKER_01: Not only was I not born here, didn't grow up here like,
SPEAKER_01: and I leave often.
SPEAKER_01: She does, she travels a lot.
SPEAKER_01: So
SPEAKER_02: when you say get out of the country,
SPEAKER_02: she does probably more than you.
SPEAKER_02: Go back to where you're from.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, that sounds like a nice vacation.
SPEAKER_02: It's funny.
SPEAKER_02: It really is.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, no, that argument, it's
Unknown: very
SPEAKER_02: weak, you know?
SPEAKER_02: Like obviously, if you care about something,
SPEAKER_02: you want to stay and help make it better.
SPEAKER_02: Like just saying,
SPEAKER_01: get out, get out, doesn't
Unknown: really...
SPEAKER_01: You know, you would think that Twitter is like
SPEAKER_01: conducive to discourse,
SPEAKER_01: but it's actually just conducive to people
SPEAKER_01: almost like reflexively regurgitating
SPEAKER_01: the last thing that they heard.
SPEAKER_01: Or like, it's almost like some of these people
SPEAKER_01: have like five go-to moves, right?
SPEAKER_01: Like they have their queue, which is like,
SPEAKER_01: go back to your queue, go back to your
Unknown: queue.
SPEAKER_01: They have their W.
SPEAKER_01: You whore, you whore, you whore.
SPEAKER_01: You know?
SPEAKER_01: And then they have an alt.
SPEAKER_01: You don't want to see the alt.
SPEAKER_01: You don't want to see the alt.
SPEAKER_01: It's crazy.
SPEAKER_02: Wait, speaking of Twitter,
SPEAKER_02: it's crazy, it makes me think of like...
Unknown: Dude,
SPEAKER_02: it's so sad.
SPEAKER_02: In the past, or maybe current too,
SPEAKER_02: like some of our friends always had like
SPEAKER_02: these crazy Twitter
Unknown: people,
SPEAKER_02: stalkers, whatever, that, you know,
SPEAKER_02: the authorities will not do anything about.
SPEAKER_02: So it just makes
SPEAKER_00: me like,
SPEAKER_01: it's sad, you know?
SPEAKER_01: I am sad that it became so unregulated
SPEAKER_01: because once upon a time it was so fun
SPEAKER_01: and there are still a lot of fun parts to Twitter,
SPEAKER_01: but
Unknown: it's
SPEAKER_01: hard to engage with it
SPEAKER_01: when there's also so much
Unknown: cuteness.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It's almost like Twitter like,
Unknown: like, absorbed
SPEAKER_01: 4chan or something
SPEAKER_01: and you're like, why is this here?
Unknown: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I've had to connect so many of my female friends
SPEAKER_01: with
Unknown: like

SPEAKER_01: because people just have like deep fakes of them
SPEAKER_01: made and circulated all the time,
SPEAKER_01: like

SPEAKER_02: You ever like learned
Unknown: a
SPEAKER_02: friend money?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, wow.
SPEAKER_02: That was a long, guttural, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Go on.
Unknown: But
SPEAKER_02: then it's like, if you lend a friend money,
SPEAKER_02: you can't expect it
Unknown: back, I guess.
SPEAKER_01: Is it not like the point of lending?
SPEAKER_01: That's different than giving.
SPEAKER_01: I'd be giving people money too.
SPEAKER_01: You do give money.
SPEAKER_01: Lending is different than
SPEAKER_02: giving.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but when you give it to friends,
Unknown: it's
SPEAKER_02: kind of like, you know the saying
SPEAKER_02: like you just don't expect it back
SPEAKER_02: if you give money to friends or family.
SPEAKER_02: I agree and I disagree.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: I
SPEAKER_01: agree that if you put yourself
SPEAKER_01: in a situation where you're
Unknown: lending someone
SPEAKER_01: money,
SPEAKER_01: you
Unknown: should
SPEAKER_01: expect the, not expect,
SPEAKER_01: you should anticipate the worst case scenario
SPEAKER_01: where you don't get any of it back
SPEAKER_01: in the sense that you shouldn't put yourself
SPEAKER_01: in a financially complicated situation.
SPEAKER_01: I agree.
SPEAKER_01: However,
Unknown: if
SPEAKER_01: I am friends with this person,
Unknown: yes,
SPEAKER_01: I
Unknown: do
SPEAKER_01: expect if we were to continue
SPEAKER_01: and uphold the friendship that they pay me back
SPEAKER_01: because
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_01: feel like
Unknown: otherwise
SPEAKER_01: there's no real trust in that friendship.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I agree with you,
SPEAKER_02: but life doesn't happen that way.
SPEAKER_02: Most of the time I find,
Unknown: you
SPEAKER_02: just feel like you're thinking about something
SPEAKER_02: in particular, Miss Pichu.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, there's been panel of moments in my life
SPEAKER_02: in the pay-us where I'll lend you this money
Unknown: with
SPEAKER_02: the expectation that I'll get paid back,
SPEAKER_02: but then like people forget and time goes on
SPEAKER_02: and you're like, and you just write it off, right?
SPEAKER_01: You ask?
SPEAKER_02: Well, I mean, I'll ask like once or twice
SPEAKER_02: and I'm like, I'm like, I'm not gonna like,
SPEAKER_02: where's my money
Unknown: every
SPEAKER_02: week, you know?
SPEAKER_02: Like a drug dealer?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah,
SPEAKER_01: like giving my money.
SPEAKER_02: Drug dealer,
Unknown: literally.
SPEAKER_01: I agree.
SPEAKER_01: I think after like two, three times,
SPEAKER_01: the onus is 100% on the other person
SPEAKER_01: to be paying you back.
Unknown: But
SPEAKER_02: I feel like overall, you know,
SPEAKER_02: I'm okay with
Unknown: giving
SPEAKER_02: money in like other ways.
SPEAKER_02: Like
Unknown: if
SPEAKER_02: everyone's eating together
SPEAKER_02: and you put the bill.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, I love that.
SPEAKER_02: You do that a lot.
SPEAKER_01: Poki does
SPEAKER_02: do that a lot.
SPEAKER_02: I
SPEAKER_01: love doing that.
Unknown: What's
SPEAKER_01: on your phone?
Unknown: As
SPEAKER_01: you're talking,
SPEAKER_01: I'm trying to look up some receipts.
SPEAKER_01: Keep going.
SPEAKER_01: Keep telling stories.
SPEAKER_01: So do
Unknown: you
SPEAKER_01: want to elaborate
SPEAKER_01: on what happened with this person?
SPEAKER_02: It was a long time ago.
SPEAKER_02: I know other people actually,
SPEAKER_02: stories from other friends
SPEAKER_02: who have lent their friends like
Unknown: a
SPEAKER_02: lot of money, right?
SPEAKER_02: Just nothing back.
SPEAKER_02: Or like they owe a lot of money,
SPEAKER_02: but
Unknown: nothing
SPEAKER_02: back.
Unknown: Like
SPEAKER_02: I know a friend who like,
Unknown: for
SPEAKER_02: like years, they didn't get this money
SPEAKER_02: where they had like a car,
SPEAKER_02: they lent the car to someone
SPEAKER_02: and then they crashed the car.
Unknown: But
SPEAKER_02: then so they owed money to the friend
SPEAKER_02: who let the friend borrow the car.
SPEAKER_01: It was a lot of money
SPEAKER_02: and it was like years and years of like nothing.
SPEAKER_02: But
Unknown: that's
SPEAKER_02: not really a friend thing, I guess.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: I recall that.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, you
SPEAKER_01: know that story?
SPEAKER_01: It was a
SPEAKER_02: lot,
SPEAKER_01: a lot, a lot.
SPEAKER_02: No?
SPEAKER_02: It was a lot.
SPEAKER_02: I also hear from other people like,
SPEAKER_02: oh, I
Unknown: lent this
SPEAKER_02: amount to
Unknown: this
SPEAKER_02: person,
SPEAKER_02: but
Unknown: nothing
SPEAKER_02: back.
SPEAKER_02: I'm just like the common thing I'm learning
SPEAKER_02: is there are a lot of instances
SPEAKER_02: where
Unknown: you
SPEAKER_02: must anticipate
SPEAKER_02: that you will not
Unknown: get
SPEAKER_02: your money back.
SPEAKER_02: Which is,
SPEAKER_01: I
SPEAKER_02: try to frame it like,
SPEAKER_02: okay,
SPEAKER_01: they must have really needed it, you know?
SPEAKER_01: If someone doesn't pay you back, that's not okay, Lily.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah,
SPEAKER_02: but maybe they really need it.
SPEAKER_02: I'm like,
SPEAKER_01: okay.
SPEAKER_01: How close have you gotten
SPEAKER_01: into confronting someone about it?
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_02: don't think
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_02: confront that heavily.
SPEAKER_02: Like, I'll just
Unknown: let
SPEAKER_02: it go.
Unknown: At
SPEAKER_02: the end of the day,
SPEAKER_02: I just think, you know, maybe you need it.
SPEAKER_02: Let's just move on.
Unknown: And
SPEAKER_02: just be more careful with lending in the future,
SPEAKER_02: you know?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
Unknown: Do
SPEAKER_01: you remain friends with these people?
SPEAKER_01: Do you feel like your friendship changes
SPEAKER_01: after they don't give you the money back?
SPEAKER_02: I definitely like lose a bit of trust.
Unknown: Like,
SPEAKER_02: I definitely like,
Unknown: I'm
SPEAKER_02: like, I won't,
SPEAKER_02: I probably won't lend you money like that again.
Unknown: And
SPEAKER_02: that's fine.
SPEAKER_02: Other than that, let's just move
Unknown: on.
SPEAKER_02: Say la vie, what are you gonna do?
SPEAKER_02: I'm not a drug dealer, man.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not gonna knock on your door and be like,
SPEAKER_02: yo, where's my money?
SPEAKER_02: You know?
SPEAKER_02: My
SPEAKER_01: money, I'm not, I just
SPEAKER_02: feel
SPEAKER_01: weird.
SPEAKER_01: I am looking up DMs between me and a content creator who,
SPEAKER_01: ooh, I think I know this.
SPEAKER_01: You probably do.
SPEAKER_01: Who asked me and many, many, many others
Unknown: for
SPEAKER_01: a lot of money.
SPEAKER_01: Oh yeah, I remember this.
SPEAKER_01: Collective, okay, let me explain a few things.
SPEAKER_01: For starters, when I first met them,
SPEAKER_01: they were a very,
Unknown: very
SPEAKER_01: large content creator.
SPEAKER_01: And the weekend that I met them,
SPEAKER_01: and it was like an event convention type beat,
Unknown: and he
SPEAKER_01: would flex how much he was making.
SPEAKER_01: He's like, oh, like just for this appearance
SPEAKER_01: or just for hosting this thing,
SPEAKER_01: I'm making like
Unknown: $300
SPEAKER_01: ,000, blah, blah, blah.
SPEAKER_01: And again, I didn't even know him like that.
SPEAKER_01: So I'm like, damn,
Unknown: his
SPEAKER_01: pockets must be so deep,
Unknown: right?
SPEAKER_01: And then maybe, okay, there's a really, really weird
Unknown: side
SPEAKER_01: thing that happened
Unknown: where
SPEAKER_01: he had a conflict
SPEAKER_01: with someone else and long story short.
SPEAKER_01: Through that, I was a witness to it.
Unknown: And
SPEAKER_01: I basically found out
Unknown: kind
SPEAKER_01: of that he could lie
SPEAKER_01: about things very easily.
SPEAKER_01: He starts DMing me a lot and starts telling me
SPEAKER_01: that he needs money because
Unknown: tax
SPEAKER_01: issues.
SPEAKER_01: So I think that this was someone who ended up making
SPEAKER_01: a lot of money
Unknown: but
SPEAKER_01: didn't manage it the best
SPEAKER_01: and then owed the IRS like
Unknown: a
SPEAKER_01: lot.
Unknown: If
SPEAKER_01: you give me a couple of minutes,
SPEAKER_01: I can maybe find the original texts,
SPEAKER_01: but
Unknown: at
SPEAKER_01: some point he like asks me
SPEAKER_01: for maybe a
Unknown: couple
SPEAKER_01: thousand or something
SPEAKER_01: and I say yes,
Unknown: maybe
SPEAKER_01: a couple more and I'm like, okay.
Unknown: And
SPEAKER_01: he kept promising me the money back
SPEAKER_01: but he never
Unknown: repaid
SPEAKER_01: me.
SPEAKER_01: So when he kept asking me for more,
SPEAKER_01: I was like, maybe if you paid me back to other times.
Unknown: And
SPEAKER_01: then he would try to
Unknown: offer
SPEAKER_01: me different things
SPEAKER_01: for me to give him money.
SPEAKER_01: Once he even sent me
Unknown: like
SPEAKER_01: what was supposed to be
SPEAKER_01: like
Unknown: a
SPEAKER_01: persuasive and loving video
SPEAKER_01: because he also made like YouTube videos.
SPEAKER_01: So he like edited this thing
SPEAKER_01: to like convince me to give him money.
SPEAKER_01: Right, that's odd, right?
SPEAKER_01: Anyways, once
Unknown: that
SPEAKER_01: didn't stop working,
SPEAKER_01: sorry, once that stopped working
SPEAKER_01: and I was like, listen, I've already given you,
SPEAKER_01: I don't remember the exact numbers.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe it was between like two to 8K,
SPEAKER_01: sorry, two to 10,000.
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_01: was like,
Unknown: maybe
SPEAKER_01: in the future I can lend you more
Unknown: but
SPEAKER_01: you keep saying, hey, I'm gonna make these videos
SPEAKER_01: and I'm gonna pay you back
SPEAKER_01: but you haven't been doing it.
Unknown: So
SPEAKER_01: once that stopped working,
Unknown: he
SPEAKER_01: said, can I ask you for a favor that requires no money?
Unknown: But
SPEAKER_01: if you can do it, it will quite literally
SPEAKER_01: pull me out of debt completely.
SPEAKER_01: Every last penny, all I need is for you to hear me out
SPEAKER_01: because this could be super duper easy.
Unknown: I'm
SPEAKER_01: actually not sure.
SPEAKER_01: I said,
Unknown: what
SPEAKER_01: is it?
Unknown: He
SPEAKER_01: goes, okay, is there anyone you know
SPEAKER_01: that can help me get an account verified?
SPEAKER_01: Because if I help this game dev get verified,
SPEAKER_01: he's going to give me potentially $200,000
Unknown: which
SPEAKER_01: will go to paying off my debts.
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_01: said, LMAO what?
SPEAKER_01: Listen, one, why do you think I can get someone verified?
SPEAKER_01: I don't work at Twitter.
SPEAKER_01: She's Pokemon.
SPEAKER_01: Two, someone's paying you $200,000 to get verified?
SPEAKER_01: Three, where's my cut?
SPEAKER_01: If that were to occur.
SPEAKER_01: Anyways, I literally say LMAO what?
SPEAKER_01: He goes, LOL, I know.
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_01: almost just said that.
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_01: said, how much debt are you in right now?
Unknown: They
SPEAKER_01: said, maybe around 25,000 to people
SPEAKER_01: and 75 to the IRS
SPEAKER_01: but I've been paying monthly for a few years now
SPEAKER_01: so this would abolish both.
SPEAKER_01: I'm like, so you're just trying to make a hundred,
SPEAKER_01: can't you're not even offering me?
SPEAKER_01: So like, off the top, whatever.
SPEAKER_01: Guys, I have not reread these messages in years
SPEAKER_01: so
Unknown: look
SPEAKER_01: here, I'm like.
SPEAKER_03: This is kind
SPEAKER_01: of hilarious because I'm
Unknown: a little,
SPEAKER_01: I am very upfront, I'll say that much.
SPEAKER_01: And we love that about you.
SPEAKER_01: Do you
SPEAKER_03: want to read my second response?
Unknown: Bro,
SPEAKER_02: just work on your craft
SPEAKER_02: and get the money back slowly.
SPEAKER_02: I ain't Twitter, I can't verify shit.
Unknown: And
SPEAKER_02: then he says, darn.
Unknown: And
SPEAKER_02: then
Unknown: she
SPEAKER_02: says,
SPEAKER_02: but I don't recommend trying to get
Unknown: rich,
SPEAKER_02: quick schemes.
SPEAKER_02: Don't trust someone who's giving 200K to get verified.
SPEAKER_02: Clearly.
SPEAKER_01: Anyways, oh fuck, it scrolled up.
SPEAKER_01: But literally as I told you guys, I said,
Unknown: I was
SPEAKER_01: like, I'm not Twitter, I can't do shit.
SPEAKER_01: And
Unknown: this
SPEAKER_01: is someone again who like has a big following online.
SPEAKER_01: I'm like,
Unknown: just
SPEAKER_01: work, like you can pay off all of this money.
SPEAKER_01: But I think
Unknown: that
SPEAKER_01: wasn't really the issue here.
SPEAKER_01: If you know what I mean.
SPEAKER_01: I said, yeah, I ain't Twitter, I can't verify shit,
SPEAKER_01: but I don't recommend trying to do get rich, quick schemes.
SPEAKER_01: Like also who the hell is gonna pay 200K to get verified?
SPEAKER_01: They're gonna get verified and be like, got them.
SPEAKER_01: Anyways, I think that's basically it.
SPEAKER_01: He never paid me back,
SPEAKER_01: but at least I didn't lose like more money to him, you know?
SPEAKER_01: It was just the initial.
SPEAKER_01: And as he kept asking for stuff,
Unknown: and
SPEAKER_01: it's especially tough because it's always like,
SPEAKER_01: you can save me, you can make such a difference.
SPEAKER_01: Like he really knows how to make people
SPEAKER_01: feel good about themselves.
Unknown: She
SPEAKER_01: said no.
Unknown: Crazy.
SPEAKER_01: Anyways.
SPEAKER_02: Sometimes, you know,
SPEAKER_02: you know, even doing content creation for so long,
Unknown: you
SPEAKER_02: see people come and go all the time.
SPEAKER_02: And I remember certain names, like how
Unknown: big,
SPEAKER_02: how
Unknown: popular,
SPEAKER_02: influential, wealthy,
SPEAKER_02: or whatever someone used to be.
SPEAKER_02: And then like, then I see
Unknown: stuff
SPEAKER_02: like that, which is...
SPEAKER_02: Did you know who it was already?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I remember this.
SPEAKER_02: You told me about this, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I
SPEAKER_01: heard
SPEAKER_02: through other people too,
SPEAKER_02: that
Unknown: he
SPEAKER_01: was asking a lot of people for money.
SPEAKER_01: People just
SPEAKER_02: for money, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And he's not the only one.
SPEAKER_01: I think I've come across maybe like three creators
SPEAKER_01: throughout my time
Unknown: that
SPEAKER_01: ended up doing that
SPEAKER_01: in like different crowds.
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_01: think between friends,
SPEAKER_01: luckily I haven't really had like really good friends.
SPEAKER_01: Not many of my friends
Unknown: have
SPEAKER_01: asked me for money.
SPEAKER_02: But you can bet if I ever need money,
SPEAKER_02: I will knock on her DMs.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: No, but the thing is like, if you need money,
SPEAKER_02: I would just let you live with me.
SPEAKER_01: You can have my bank account, I don't care.
SPEAKER_01: Oh my
SPEAKER_02: God.
SPEAKER_01: I wouldn't even like loan.
SPEAKER_01: I wouldn't like loan too, I don't like that, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you, I'm gonna gamble it all now.
SPEAKER_01: I really do feel like,
Unknown: especially
SPEAKER_01: depending on where you live,
SPEAKER_01: if you don't feel like you can entirely trust
SPEAKER_01: your government to take care of you,
SPEAKER_01: I feel like you need to kind of create
SPEAKER_01: these like socialist circles where it's like,
SPEAKER_01: you got me, you got me, yeah, right?
SPEAKER_02: Like just in case.
SPEAKER_02: I do do that a lot.
SPEAKER_02: I feel like that's the best
SPEAKER_01: you can do.
SPEAKER_01: I always talk to Ludwig, I'm always telling him,
SPEAKER_01: hey,
Unknown: if
SPEAKER_01: I ever want to quit everything,
SPEAKER_01: it's just so true.
SPEAKER_01: Sometimes Lily will be texting me
SPEAKER_01: and she'll
Unknown: be
SPEAKER_01: having some sort of crisis.
SPEAKER_01: She'll be like, I just messaged Ludwig
SPEAKER_01: and asked if I could get a job.
SPEAKER_01: And like, I think that's so cute,
SPEAKER_01: but I'm like, I wasn't your first choice, you bitch.
SPEAKER_01: It's because he has a job available.
SPEAKER_01: That's true, he does have a full-on company.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, and that's why
SPEAKER_02: I was like,
SPEAKER_02: oh, you have a company, can I work for your company?
SPEAKER_02: I'm like, I can be competent
SPEAKER_02: and he's like, you don't even need to be competent.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
Unknown: And
SPEAKER_02: he's like, yeah, you can play piano for me
SPEAKER_02: when I'm starting my stream.
SPEAKER_01: Ludwig would be lucky to hire you,
SPEAKER_01: I'll tell you that much.
Unknown: He
SPEAKER_01: seems pretty chill.
SPEAKER_01: I have had a couple
Unknown: issues,
Unknown: like
SPEAKER_01: doing work-related things with friends.
SPEAKER_01: I'm not sure how I feel about that.
SPEAKER_01: And let me preface, when I say that,
SPEAKER_01: I mean employing people that are not
Unknown: in
SPEAKER_01: this sphere.
SPEAKER_01: I don't mean streamer friends.
Unknown: If I
SPEAKER_01: met you through streaming,
SPEAKER_01: our relationship is already
Unknown: to
SPEAKER_01: some degree business,
SPEAKER_01: but I mean people who like I was just friends with before,
SPEAKER_01: but then I'm like, oh, maybe this opportunity comes along.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you want to give your friend a job.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I understand that, I've done it.
SPEAKER_01: There have been some instances where like,
SPEAKER_01: I know someone kind of needs money,
SPEAKER_01: so I just
Unknown: overpay
SPEAKER_01: them to the extreme,
Unknown: which
SPEAKER_01: I don't mind at all.
SPEAKER_01: To me, it's almost like a loophole,
SPEAKER_01: like I get to give you money,
Unknown: and like
SPEAKER_01: that's legal.
SPEAKER_01: But unfortunately,
Unknown: in
SPEAKER_01: most, if not every one of those instances,
SPEAKER_01: I am not
Unknown: too,
SPEAKER_01: I don't want to say I'm not happy with the work.
Unknown: I'm
SPEAKER_01: not happy with the level of effort.
SPEAKER_01: Like, I know
Unknown: whatever
SPEAKER_01: work
Unknown: comes
SPEAKER_01: out of a project
Unknown: isn't
SPEAKER_01: always going to be what you expect,
Unknown: but
SPEAKER_01: at the very least, if I'm friends with someone,
SPEAKER_01: if we have some level of understanding,
SPEAKER_01: if also I'm trying so hard
Unknown: to
SPEAKER_01: frankly overpay them for something,
Unknown: at
SPEAKER_01: the very least, I just want to feel like they're really trying.
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_02: think it's like a, wow,
SPEAKER_02: so like
Unknown: it
SPEAKER_02: should be that,
SPEAKER_02: oh, you gave someone this really good opportunity
SPEAKER_02: because they're your friend and you are overpaying them.
SPEAKER_02: They should, I feel like they should also work hard to like,
SPEAKER_02: you know, be like, oh, you know, really great.
SPEAKER_02: At least try, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Exactly, but I feel like oftentimes it goes
Unknown: the
SPEAKER_02: opposite way.
SPEAKER_02: But they take it for granted.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, she's a friend.
SPEAKER_02: Like, you know, she'll understand, like, it goes opposite.
SPEAKER_02: I've
Unknown: been
SPEAKER_02: through that too, where I'm
SPEAKER_01: like, uh, uh,
SPEAKER_02: uh.
Unknown: Yeah,
SPEAKER_01: I think I kind of learned,
SPEAKER_01: like sometimes
Unknown: in
SPEAKER_01: an effort to be nice,
SPEAKER_01: you end up presenting yourself as someone
SPEAKER_01: who's easy to take advantage of,
SPEAKER_01: even if people
Unknown: aren't
SPEAKER_01: actively and intentionally thinking,
SPEAKER_01: let me take advantage.
SPEAKER_01: They're like, oh, she's being easygoing.
SPEAKER_01: So if I don't put that much effort,
SPEAKER_01: she'll still be easygoing.
SPEAKER_01: But it's like,
SPEAKER_02: I'm going to take advantage of someone.
SPEAKER_02: Like nobody
SPEAKER_01: really thinks that they don't,
SPEAKER_01: I think oftentimes you don't even realize.
Unknown: Ah,
SPEAKER_01: I think I told you,
SPEAKER_01: I ended up in this
Unknown: situation
SPEAKER_01: of sorts
SPEAKER_01: where I was paying someone
Unknown: monthly
SPEAKER_01: to help me
SPEAKER_01: and then I didn't really need their help
SPEAKER_01: for a specific month.
SPEAKER_01: So my team like decided,
SPEAKER_01: okay,
Unknown: like we're
SPEAKER_01: going to end the working relationship here.
Unknown: And
SPEAKER_01: then when we tried to communicate that to that person,
SPEAKER_01: because we have like a personal relationship,
SPEAKER_01: they were speaking to my manager
Unknown: and
SPEAKER_01: they said like,
SPEAKER_01: oh, I'm going to go ask Poki
SPEAKER_01: if she can pay me for an extra month
SPEAKER_01: because well, like I have bills
Unknown: and
SPEAKER_02: like that's that.
SPEAKER_01: And
Unknown: it
SPEAKER_01: was a little bit
Unknown: awkward
SPEAKER_01: sort of
SPEAKER_01: because like from a company perspective,
SPEAKER_01: it's like, well, like
Unknown: we
SPEAKER_01: just don't need the services
SPEAKER_01: that we're
Unknown: contracting
SPEAKER_01: you for.
SPEAKER_01: I think that's why they say don't mix business with friends
SPEAKER_01: for this reason.
SPEAKER_01: But, you know, if
Unknown: a
SPEAKER_01: friend is like,
SPEAKER_01: well,
Unknown: like the
SPEAKER_01: money would be nice.
Unknown: Yeah,
SPEAKER_01: I also know that.
SPEAKER_01: Exactly. So
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_01: was like, okay,
SPEAKER_01: we'll just pay you for the extra month.
SPEAKER_01: And then basically they were managing
Unknown: one project
SPEAKER_01: and we didn't give them any other work.
SPEAKER_01: And the project
Unknown: ended
SPEAKER_01: up,
SPEAKER_01: I mean, it's their kind of responsibility to manage
SPEAKER_01: and it took a little bit longer than the month
SPEAKER_01: because of delays that were
Unknown: out
SPEAKER_01: of my hand,
SPEAKER_01: whatever was going on on their end.
SPEAKER_01: And essentially as soon as it passed the official month date
Unknown: and
SPEAKER_01: they like showed me it
SPEAKER_01: and we had to do a round of feedback,
SPEAKER_01: they're like, okay, I'll be charging you hourly now for that.
SPEAKER_01: And that
Unknown: kind
SPEAKER_01: of put me off because I was like,
SPEAKER_01: I didn't even need to pay you for this entire month, technically.
SPEAKER_01: And like the moment that we're beyond it
Unknown: for
SPEAKER_01: delays that are not my fault
SPEAKER_01: and in a way are kind of your responsibility
SPEAKER_01: since you're managing this.
SPEAKER_01: And you promised me a due date that was weeks ago.
SPEAKER_01: I need to pay more because of that too.
SPEAKER_01: And it just felt like, okay,
SPEAKER_01: I was willing
Unknown: to
SPEAKER_01: contract you for longer
SPEAKER_01: and pay you for longer because you're my friend.
Unknown: But
SPEAKER_01: now that I just want you to like
SPEAKER_01: wrap the project and it's a little bit past the retainer date,
SPEAKER_01: you're not willing to do that for me as a friend.
SPEAKER_01: And it felt kind of infusing.
SPEAKER_01: Do you get what I mean?
SPEAKER_01: I understand.
SPEAKER_01: It's
Unknown: so...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah,
SPEAKER_02: that
Unknown: working
SPEAKER_02: with friends I feel
SPEAKER_02: is
Unknown: sometimes
SPEAKER_02: a dice roll
SPEAKER_02: because you have to manage like your personal relationship
SPEAKER_02: but also you are paying them to do something
Unknown: but
SPEAKER_02: when that gets really like messy and blurry,
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_02: think it's
Unknown: personal
SPEAKER_02: preference
SPEAKER_02: how you want to go about it, you know?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah,
SPEAKER_01: I think what that taught me is
Unknown: you
SPEAKER_01: could be friends with someone for a very long time
Unknown: but
SPEAKER_01: how someone does business
SPEAKER_01: tends to be completely different.
SPEAKER_01: That's also very true.
SPEAKER_01: Like you would really, really be surprised.
SPEAKER_01: I'll take it a step further.
SPEAKER_01: Let me tell you about working with family.
SPEAKER_01: Wait, can I interject quickly?
SPEAKER_01: Okay, I'm sorry.
SPEAKER_01: Just to wrap this up, sorry.
SPEAKER_01: I wasn't
SPEAKER_02: actually
SPEAKER_01: gonna...
SPEAKER_01: Well, you could but
SPEAKER_01: because I'm sure that has its own complications too.
SPEAKER_01: Oh yeah, we can hear from both ends.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, I was just gonna say,
SPEAKER_01: I spoke to my therapist about this
SPEAKER_01: and they really clocked me.
SPEAKER_01: They basically said like,
SPEAKER_01: oh, these people like that are your friends
SPEAKER_01: that you're really looking to help.
Unknown: You
SPEAKER_01: know, let's say they're XYZ age
SPEAKER_01: or in whatever situations
SPEAKER_01: and they can't hold a stable job
SPEAKER_01: and like you're trying to be there
Unknown: and
SPEAKER_01: provide a source of income for them.
SPEAKER_01: You have these expectations of them
SPEAKER_01: when it comes to work,
SPEAKER_01: but don't you think
Unknown: if
SPEAKER_01: they were that competent,
SPEAKER_01: they maybe wouldn't have wound up
SPEAKER_01: in that position in a way?
SPEAKER_01: I was like, shit.
SPEAKER_01: Like maybe they wouldn't really be needing
SPEAKER_01: your help to this extent
SPEAKER_01: if like they just really did good work.
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_01: was like, oh, that's a fucking loaded question.
SPEAKER_02: Anyways.
SPEAKER_02: I talked a little about this with Ludwig
SPEAKER_02: actually the past, like he employs his friends
SPEAKER_02: and like it's just a, he employs a lot of people.
SPEAKER_02: He sure does, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And some of them are like, they go above and beyond.
SPEAKER_02: Like they're like
Unknown: fucking
SPEAKER_02: stars.
SPEAKER_01: But some of them might not like quite make the activity.
SPEAKER_01: There's
SPEAKER_02: like, you know.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah,
SPEAKER_01: depends how someone is with business and work, truly.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's kind of interesting in a way.
SPEAKER_02: Business makes things
SPEAKER_01: complicated,
SPEAKER_02: especially when you make personal feelings into it.
SPEAKER_02: I think navigating that is just so fucking hard.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Like it's not
SPEAKER_01: easy.
SPEAKER_01: And I feel like I just really learned
SPEAKER_01: like it's almost like someone has a
Unknown: personal
SPEAKER_01: friend face
SPEAKER_01: and they have a business face
Unknown: and
SPEAKER_01: they maybe have like a romantic relationships face.
SPEAKER_01: Like people just have different facets to them
SPEAKER_01: depending on
Unknown: the
SPEAKER_01: thing, yeah?
SPEAKER_01: Couples that work together are fascinating to me.
SPEAKER_01: I'm like, man, how is
SPEAKER_02: your relationship intact?
SPEAKER_01: Actually,
SPEAKER_02: it's
SPEAKER_01: kind of like.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, sorry.

SPEAKER_01: Like Annie Albert.
Unknown: Box,
SPEAKER_01: box.
SPEAKER_01: There's a lot of people.
SPEAKER_01: There's a lot of couples that work together.
SPEAKER_01: To be honest, I think I'm someone
SPEAKER_01: who it probably would not work for me
SPEAKER_01: because I have kooky, kooky part in my language,
SPEAKER_01: anal expectations when it comes to work.
SPEAKER_01: I don't want to put that on my partner.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe in like low lift
Unknown: ways,
SPEAKER_01: like a little thing here and there.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, but like working with them all the time.
SPEAKER_01: It's hard.
SPEAKER_01: Good Lord, no.
SPEAKER_01: I
SPEAKER_02: have Michael,
SPEAKER_01: whichever work
SPEAKER_02: with
SPEAKER_01: me.
SPEAKER_01: And he's like,
Unknown: fuck no.
SPEAKER_02: And I'm like, you know what?
SPEAKER_02: That's my answer
SPEAKER_01: too.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, tell them.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Tom, you're gonna go work for me at Ludwig.
SPEAKER_01: What?
SPEAKER_01: It also reminds me of like,
SPEAKER_01: you know how sometimes you can be friends with,
SPEAKER_01: I think more so a guy than a girl.
SPEAKER_01: I feel like I know my girlfriends pretty well,
SPEAKER_01: but sometimes like I could know a guy,
SPEAKER_01: but I could have no idea what he's like in a relationship.
SPEAKER_03: Like
SPEAKER_01: that could be a completely different side to him
SPEAKER_01: where I would be like surprised or confused or like,
SPEAKER_01: there's some guys like I maybe just game with.
SPEAKER_01: So I feel like I only know one facet of them.
SPEAKER_01: I could hear relationship stories about them
SPEAKER_01: and be like, whoa.
SPEAKER_01: And then I have to like reconcile the two.
SPEAKER_01: That's what I'm learning about
SPEAKER_01: mixing
Unknown: friends
SPEAKER_01: and business.
SPEAKER_01: Like if you don't know that side, it could be anything.
SPEAKER_01: Speaking of like business
SPEAKER_02: and
SPEAKER_01: friends, I just feel like-
SPEAKER_01: Shall we
SPEAKER_02: kiss?
SPEAKER_02: Huh?
SPEAKER_02: We are friends who do business.
SPEAKER_01: Anyways, you were gonna say?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we
SPEAKER_02: do do business.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we do.

SPEAKER_01: I
SPEAKER_02: don't anticipate it, I really don't.
SPEAKER_02: There's like streamer friendships
SPEAKER_02: is what I consider mixing business
SPEAKER_02: with friendship quite often.
Unknown: And
SPEAKER_02: you know, I've talked about this before
SPEAKER_02: where it took me a long time to realize
SPEAKER_02: like if you just treat it as like a purely streamer relationship,
SPEAKER_02: I will be much happier in the long run
SPEAKER_02: because I won't have expectations
SPEAKER_02: and they don't have expectations
SPEAKER_02: instead of like
Unknown: putting
SPEAKER_02: my personal feelings onto that.
SPEAKER_02: But it's a lot of like,
Unknown: it's
SPEAKER_02: a lot of that.
SPEAKER_02: Who would
SPEAKER_01: have thunk that like
Unknown: streamer
SPEAKER_01: friends
SPEAKER_01: kind of aren't like your friends?
SPEAKER_01: They really?
SPEAKER_01: I did not.
SPEAKER_01: I didn't think that for a long time.
SPEAKER_01: And no one told me.
SPEAKER_01: Me too, I thought-
SPEAKER_01: Guys, no one told-
SPEAKER_01: Can I put that on?
SPEAKER_01: No one told me.
SPEAKER_01: These people are not your friends.
SPEAKER_01: But you think-
SPEAKER_01: Well, I mean, when
SPEAKER_02: you're younger-
SPEAKER_01: Except
SPEAKER_02: you and me.
SPEAKER_02: That doesn't-
SPEAKER_02: Right?
SPEAKER_02: Are we?
SPEAKER_02: You better say right to the camera.

SPEAKER_02: You know what?
SPEAKER_02: I hate when people are-
SPEAKER_02: I forgot my streamer friends.
Unknown: When
SPEAKER_01: people are business friend streamer-
SPEAKER_01: Hold on,
SPEAKER_03: hold on,
Unknown: hold on.
Unknown: It's
SPEAKER_03: like a sneeze.
SPEAKER_02: Friend, friend, friend, friendship.
SPEAKER_02: They don't tell you that.
SPEAKER_02: Oh yeah, so when you're younger, right?
SPEAKER_02: And you're like-
SPEAKER_02: I'm gonna play on games with people
SPEAKER_02: if I like, I don't know, eight hours a day.
SPEAKER_02: And then,
SPEAKER_01: you know, I can't help it, they're my friends.
SPEAKER_01: But
SPEAKER_02: we're not friends.
SPEAKER_02: It's really-
SPEAKER_02: It's just like, people are different.
SPEAKER_02: You gotta hang with people off stream.
SPEAKER_02: Stuff like that, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: No, I'll tell you the truth.
SPEAKER_01: Why does
SPEAKER_02: she sound like a pastor?
SPEAKER_02: You just said it.
SPEAKER_02: No, I really did.
SPEAKER_02: I really did.
SPEAKER_01: You would say everything's so sweet,
SPEAKER_01: but to me it's
Unknown: like
SPEAKER_01: -
Unknown: That's
SPEAKER_01: how we're sweet and sour.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's mixed signals frequently
SPEAKER_01: when you make some, when you make content with someone
SPEAKER_01: and like, they act so hunky dory.
SPEAKER_01: They act like your friends,
SPEAKER_01: but it's like, bitch, I didn't know it was acted.
SPEAKER_01: No one said cut
Unknown: before
SPEAKER_02: you cut me.
SPEAKER_02: Wow, that was-
SPEAKER_02: Anyways, let's do one of the deepest things
SPEAKER_02: you've ever said.
SPEAKER_02: That was pretty deep.
SPEAKER_02: Thank you so much.
SPEAKER_01: That was
SPEAKER_02: deep.
SPEAKER_02: Thank you so much.
SPEAKER_01: Anyways, let's wrap it up with a song.
SPEAKER_01: No,
SPEAKER_02: just to be on a really long time,
SPEAKER_01: I'm glad that
Unknown: we
SPEAKER_01: both went on that journey
SPEAKER_01: because I really, at one point I hit a brick wall
SPEAKER_01: where I was like, who are my friends?
SPEAKER_01: Not just that, but like,
SPEAKER_01: is everybody not friends with each other?
SPEAKER_01: I think more people-
SPEAKER_01: It's fucking weird out here.
SPEAKER_01: I think more people didn't
SPEAKER_02: realize
SPEAKER_02: I had just
SPEAKER_01: acquaintances and coworkers,
SPEAKER_01: which is fun!
SPEAKER_01: The real friendships are actually the minority,
SPEAKER_01: if anything.
SPEAKER_01: Most people are just like-
SPEAKER_02: Oh,
SPEAKER_01: I took that so wrong.
SPEAKER_01: Wait, what?
SPEAKER_01: Nothing.
SPEAKER_01: I'm like, are you're just friends with minorities?
SPEAKER_01: What
Unknown: the fuck?
SPEAKER_01: We are only friends
SPEAKER_02: with
SPEAKER_01: minorities.
SPEAKER_02: Is that why?
SPEAKER_02: Am I your DEI friend hire?
SPEAKER_02: You do
SPEAKER_01: fall into a couple of
SPEAKER_02: categories.
SPEAKER_02: I'm a Korean
SPEAKER_01: friend.
SPEAKER_01: I'm competing with Celine, actually.
SPEAKER_01: Actually, you know what's funny?
SPEAKER_01: The other day, someone thought that
SPEAKER_01: someone was talking to me
SPEAKER_01: and they thought that you were Chinese.
SPEAKER_01: I was like, no, she's Korean.
SPEAKER_01: They said, isn't Chu a Chinese class name?
SPEAKER_01: I said no, her last name's not Chu.
SPEAKER_01: It's quite common,
SPEAKER_02: it's Pichu.
SPEAKER_02: Pichu is not under any-
SPEAKER_02: I just thought that was so funny.
SPEAKER_02: It's actually quite Nintendo,
SPEAKER_02: but we don't say that because they'll sue me one day.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, let's wrap it up with a soul-ass.
SPEAKER_02: Hell, heck yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Heck yeah.
SPEAKER_02: You read it, I feel like you're in the mood to read.
SPEAKER_02: Hello, Lily Pokey and team.
SPEAKER_02: Hey.
SPEAKER_02: I'm gonna practice my little voice.
Unknown: Love
SPEAKER_02: the pod, y'all are so cute.
SPEAKER_01: Love you too.
SPEAKER_02: By
SPEAKER_01: the
SPEAKER_02: way, Lily, I have been watching Witchwatch
SPEAKER_02: and you do a fantastic job.
SPEAKER_02: Really enjoying the show and your performance.
SPEAKER_02: Hey, thanks, that really means a lot.
SPEAKER_02: I haven't gotten any single new voice role
SPEAKER_02: in months and I'm so fucking depressed about that.
SPEAKER_02: Actually,
SPEAKER_01: I think about it every
SPEAKER_02: day.
SPEAKER_02: I was wondering how you would recommend
SPEAKER_02: balancing financials and friendship.
SPEAKER_02: I have a friend who is very bad with her money, 25F,
Unknown: and
SPEAKER_02: I'm a recent graduate with an engineering degree
SPEAKER_02: and have been working full-time with a decent salary
SPEAKER_02: for the last year at 23F.
SPEAKER_02: Well, look at you.
SPEAKER_02: This friend is pregnant and is not financially stable.
SPEAKER_02: Her boyfriend needs to work at some dead-end job
SPEAKER_02: at a dollar general.
SPEAKER_02: I think he might be unemployed now.
SPEAKER_02: She is working as a daycare preschool teacher.
SPEAKER_02: I have given her over $200 in the past
SPEAKER_02: before she became pregnant
SPEAKER_02: since she doesn't have much financial help from her family
SPEAKER_02: and I am fairly stable.
SPEAKER_02: I don't expect to see that money again
Unknown: and
SPEAKER_02: that is fine.
SPEAKER_02: She recently messaged me saying her and her boyfriend
SPEAKER_02: have no money for gas.
SPEAKER_02: I, of course,
Unknown: want
SPEAKER_02: to help and have Venmoed her
SPEAKER_02: some more funds, but at what point do I stop?
SPEAKER_02: I worry about her.
SPEAKER_02: She's not,
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_02: worry about her
SPEAKER_02: and she is not ready for a child.
SPEAKER_02: I've never met the BF,
Unknown: but I've
SPEAKER_02: not heard great things about him.
SPEAKER_02: I don't think he's helping her financially, emotionally.
SPEAKER_02: I'm just not sure where to go.
SPEAKER_02: Do I keep sending her money?
SPEAKER_02: As she asks, I haven't really interacted with her
SPEAKER_02: since I graduated over
Unknown: a
SPEAKER_02: year ago
SPEAKER_02: since I now live quite a ways away
SPEAKER_02: and I seem to only get messages when she needs money.
Unknown: That
SPEAKER_02: is
Unknown: sad.
SPEAKER_02: It makes me feel like a bank
SPEAKER_02: or at least a sugar daddy stuck in a young woman's body
SPEAKER_02: just without the financials law.
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_02: like that call
SPEAKER_01: back.
SPEAKER_02: Just wondering if at some point I should tell her,
SPEAKER_02: no, and at one point I should do that.
SPEAKER_02: How do I do it in a way that is helpful
SPEAKER_02: without being hurtful?
SPEAKER_02: I mean, you're out of college with student loans,
SPEAKER_02: a home loan with my partner,
SPEAKER_02: a dog and cat to care for.
SPEAKER_02: It's not like dishing out another $50 is impossible.
SPEAKER_02: It's just not ideal to keep doing it
SPEAKER_02: and in the long run won't help her fix her financials.
SPEAKER_02: I, of course, I will give her money for gas
SPEAKER_02: so she can make it to work,
SPEAKER_02: but I can't support her entirely.
SPEAKER_02: Thanks.
SPEAKER_02: Keep releasing podcasts until I retire, please.
SPEAKER_02: Engineering is very boring sometimes
SPEAKER_02: and any good you have me to listen to,
SPEAKER_02: that'll be at least another 35.
SPEAKER_02: 40 years.
SPEAKER_02: We got you.
SPEAKER_02: That is such a sweet comment.
SPEAKER_02: What is it?
SPEAKER_02: Like, that's so sweet.
SPEAKER_02: Well, first of all, I am sorry you feel like
Unknown: a
SPEAKER_02: bank.
SPEAKER_02: I know the feeling you want to help your friend.
SPEAKER_02: You know, it's not like-
SPEAKER_02: I'm not sure you're like a
SPEAKER_01: bank all the time.
SPEAKER_02: Huh?
SPEAKER_02: Huh?
SPEAKER_02: What?
Unknown: Are
SPEAKER_02: you?
Unknown: I'm
SPEAKER_02: joking.
SPEAKER_02: My love.
SPEAKER_02: Wait, wait, wait.
SPEAKER_02: Go on, go on.
SPEAKER_02: I am really hungry.
SPEAKER_02: If you could buy me a food after
Unknown: this.
SPEAKER_02: I'm down.
SPEAKER_02: I'm joking.
SPEAKER_02: I'm joking.
SPEAKER_02: Generally,
SPEAKER_01: I'm down.
SPEAKER_02: Like, you do, you know that saying
SPEAKER_02: you can't set yourself on fire.
SPEAKER_02: To keep someone else warm.
SPEAKER_01: I
SPEAKER_02: do think that applies here.
SPEAKER_02: You can't keep hurting yourself.
SPEAKER_02: I will
SPEAKER_01: say it's so sweet.
SPEAKER_01: Like, I can tell how much you care
SPEAKER_01: through this message and you're really trying.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the kindness isn't wrong.
Unknown: But
SPEAKER_02: you do need to take care of yourself.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe you can like help her
Unknown: with
SPEAKER_02: like finding a job
SPEAKER_02: or like a more concrete long-term way.
SPEAKER_02: Teach a man
SPEAKER_01: how to fish.
SPEAKER_01: Instead of give him a fish.
SPEAKER_01: Is that to say?
SPEAKER_02: Maybe you could try that.
SPEAKER_02: Like, hey, is there anything I can help
SPEAKER_02: you out like, you know,
Unknown: to
SPEAKER_02: find a job
SPEAKER_02: or like to prep for your
Unknown: child,
SPEAKER_02: etc.
SPEAKER_02: Relationship stuff is hard to comment on
SPEAKER_02: because that's their relationship.
SPEAKER_02: You don't know the ins and outs of that.
SPEAKER_02: What do you think?
SPEAKER_02: I teach a man to
SPEAKER_01: fish.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think.
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_01: also think for your sake and for hers,
SPEAKER_01: it's good for you to set maybe like a mental limit
SPEAKER_01: of how much
Unknown: you're
SPEAKER_01: willing to give her
SPEAKER_01: maybe even a month.
Unknown: And
SPEAKER_01: I think one of the best ways
SPEAKER_01: you can communicate this is like,
SPEAKER_01: hey,
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_01: care for you so much.
SPEAKER_01: I want to help.
SPEAKER_01: I've been trying to help,
Unknown: but
SPEAKER_01: I have a home loan.
SPEAKER_01: I have student loans.
SPEAKER_01: You know, I need to be financially smart
SPEAKER_01: and budget for myself.
SPEAKER_01: I could maybe help you out with this much,
SPEAKER_01: at least for the next three months.
SPEAKER_01: And hopefully by then,
Unknown: you
SPEAKER_01: can try to be set up in a way
SPEAKER_01: where you don't need to lean on me.
SPEAKER_01: Unfortunately, from my personal experience,
SPEAKER_01: I feel like sometimes when people ask for money,
Unknown: and
SPEAKER_01: you get in the habit of saying yes,
Unknown: they
SPEAKER_01: get in the habit of expecting that
Unknown: almost
SPEAKER_01: like as a source of income.
SPEAKER_01: And I think if you keep giving,
SPEAKER_01: like
Unknown: you
SPEAKER_01: feel a certain way now,
SPEAKER_01: but I'm sure at some point,
SPEAKER_01: it's going to build up and lead to resentment,
SPEAKER_01: which is not going to be healthy.
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_01: will say before you have some sort of
SPEAKER_01: conversation with her,
Unknown: please
SPEAKER_01: keep in mind if it goes sour,
SPEAKER_01: it is not your fault.
Unknown: And I
SPEAKER_01: feel like you're really trying,
SPEAKER_01: and I think as much,
SPEAKER_01: like
Unknown: as
SPEAKER_01: long as you're being nice and caring,
SPEAKER_01: it's not your fault.
SPEAKER_01: If someone doesn't want to be your friend,
SPEAKER_01: or
Unknown: wants
SPEAKER_01: to stop being your friend
SPEAKER_01: because you don't want to give them money,
Unknown: as
SPEAKER_01: sad as it is,
SPEAKER_01: probably better off ending the friendship.
Unknown: Okay,
SPEAKER_01: that's a lot of experience.
SPEAKER_01: Too much.
SPEAKER_01: I'm like, I'm also like a fucking 45-year-old
SPEAKER_01: stuck in a
Unknown: sexy
SPEAKER_01: 29-year-old bot.
SPEAKER_01: Anyway,
SPEAKER_02: your willingness to help your friend,
SPEAKER_02: I think is really,
Unknown: it's
SPEAKER_02: like really pure.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I can,
SPEAKER_02: even just the way you're writing this.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah,
SPEAKER_01: it's,
Unknown: you
SPEAKER_01: are more selfless than most,
SPEAKER_01: I'll say that much.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah,
Unknown: and
SPEAKER_02: I know what you say,
SPEAKER_02: like, oh, I worry, she's not ready for a child.
SPEAKER_02: I've waited a lot, she is an adult,
SPEAKER_02: it is her life.
SPEAKER_02: You can be there as a friend,
SPEAKER_02: but
Unknown: just
SPEAKER_02: be careful,
SPEAKER_02: you're not also like burning yourself out.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: I think there is a delicate way
SPEAKER_02: you can go about this, I do.
Unknown: Okay.
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_02: hope that helps, good luck.
Unknown: And
SPEAKER_02: we'll
Unknown: probably
SPEAKER_02: do, if I least like,
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_02: don't know, like another week of
Unknown: podcast.
SPEAKER_02: At least.
SPEAKER_02: Two weeks.
SPEAKER_01: At least two weeks.
SPEAKER_01: I'm in town for two weeks.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, I think that's the end of the episode.
