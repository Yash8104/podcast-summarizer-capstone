beerbiceps: I want to talk about your relationship as well
beerbiceps: That was the core topic of today
sonakshi: We barely talked about it
beerbiceps: But these are couple goals
beerbiceps: How did you achieve couple goals?
sonakshi: By not trying I think
sonakshi: We are literally two best friends just living life
beerbiceps: We have done the same, we are friends
sonakshi: Zaheer made me fall in love with cheesy lines
Unknown: How did he make you fall in love?
sonakshi: We met at a party at Salman's house
sonakshi: For so many years Zaheer was getting room to be in Salman's film notebook
sonakshi: I also used to go there
sonakshi: But we never met
sonakshi: For 6-7 years we used to always cross each other's paths
sonakshi: And we never met or even saw each other
Unknown: Until that one day
sonakshi: We had an introduction
Unknown: We had some stupid talks
sonakshi: We made jokes
sonakshi: I was like ok this guy is very confident
Unknown: Usually people are intimidated by me
sonakshi: I don't know why
sonakshi: At least boys at that time
sonakshi: I found his confidence very striking
sonakshi: Next day we went for tube light screening
sonakshi: The screening was over
sonakshi: After party was gathered
sonakshi: Zaheer and I danced
sonakshi: And then we went to sit in one corner
sonakshi: We were sitting in one corner
Unknown: And literally for 5 hours
sonakshi: We just spoke about everything
sonakshi: I felt like I knew this guy
Unknown: We found so many commonalities
sonakshi: Between the two of us
Unknown: It was just beautiful
sonakshi: It felt like home
beerbiceps: Was someone playing the violin?
sonakshi: I don't know what was happening
sonakshi: Literally I was just listening to him
sonakshi: That was the day we clicked
sonakshi: Since that day we have been together
Unknown: When did you fall in love?
sonakshi: I fell in love at that first chat
sonakshi: You fell in love?
sonakshi: Within a week of knowing him
sonakshi: He thought I was mad
sonakshi: He called his best friend
sonakshi: I don't think she knows the meaning of love
sonakshi: I think she is love deprived in life
sonakshi: Were you?
sonakshi: No
sonakshi: I genuinely cannot explain it
sonakshi: I never felt this way for anyone
sonakshi: He said I love you
sonakshi: He will think I am crazy
sonakshi: I said what I felt
sonakshi: I didn't want to play games
Unknown: I felt how I felt
beerbiceps: Take it or leave it
sonakshi: Cut to 7 years later we are married
sonakshi: In a month I told him I am going to marry him
beerbiceps: One month after meeting him
sonakshi: I told him I am going to marry him
beerbiceps: What did he say?
Unknown: He laughed in my face
Unknown: He actually laughed in my face
beerbiceps: I want to show the context
Unknown: What is happening here?
beerbiceps: This is an ideal relationship
Unknown: Stop encouraging him
Unknown: He annoys me
Unknown: I just love it
beerbiceps: He keeps you entertained
beerbiceps: 24x7
Unknown: Do you think it is an underrated guy skill?
sonakshi: 100%
sonakshi: There is one thing making someone laugh
sonakshi: You can do it for a while
sonakshi: But this guy has been consistently doing it for the last 8 years
beerbiceps: Do you know what is the key?
beerbiceps: There is consistency
beerbiceps: That is a traditional relationship tip
sonakshi: Compare him to a movie character
sonakshi: He is my best friend
beerbiceps: Relationships are very breakdown
beerbiceps: In the beginning of this podcast
beerbiceps: I told you that you are a big green flag
Unknown: As a woman this is a guy's perspective
beerbiceps: You are very chilled out
sonakshi: There is a balance of feminine and masculine energy
beerbiceps: When I came into this relationship
sonakshi: There was such a good balance
sonakshi: When I reached this relationship
Unknown: I realized that this is healthy
sonakshi: Applause comes from both hands
sonakshi: Love should be in both places
sonakshi: Respect should be in both places
beerbiceps: Love is friendship
beerbiceps: If there is no friendship, there is nothing
sonakshi: Love can fade away after so many years
sonakshi: But friendship is something that will always be there
sonakshi: Eventually you want a hangout buddy in marriage
sonakshi: I think so, companionship is very important
sonakshi: But if there is love on it, then it will be a perfect match
beerbiceps: Are you enjoying the marriage?
sonakshi: I am enjoying it a lot
beerbiceps: How long have you been dating?
sonakshi: We started dating in 2017
beerbiceps: So 8 years
sonakshi: Out of which 1 year we have been married
beerbiceps: All that happened in the 7th year
sonakshi: We got married in the 7th year
beerbiceps: Maybe after the itch
sonakshi: There was just a click
sonakshi: That I already know this person
sonakshi: It was very weird
sonakshi: Because I didn't feel like this for anyone
beerbiceps: Has he molded himself a bit
beerbiceps: To be better as a partner for you?
sonakshi: No, I think the beauty of it is that
Unknown: He lets me be and I let him be
sonakshi: Even if we have had our differences
sonakshi: We have worked our way around it
sonakshi: So that he can be exactly the way he is
sonakshi: What was your type?
sonakshi: My type was serious
sonakshi: Brutal, mature, quiet
sonakshi: Because I know how long you have to be away
sonakshi: I just didn't want to be with someone
Unknown: Who I had to deal with that for
beerbiceps: Being an actor's partner is difficult
sonakshi: Yes, it is
sonakshi: Why is it difficult?
sonakshi: I want my husband to not go for a shoot for a month
beerbiceps: My husband should be with me
sonakshi: It is a very comfortable space
sonakshi: Zaheer is predominantly a real estate developer
sonakshi: So he is a good balance between business and acting
beerbiceps: Thank you
