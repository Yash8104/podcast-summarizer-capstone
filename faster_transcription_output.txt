SPEAKER_02: the dog
SPEAKER_02: and the dog shit that comes with dogs,
SPEAKER_02: your robot might have a problem.
SPEAKER_02: The one thing I've heard is dog shit clashes with it.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, I'll keep that in mind.

SPEAKER_02: for like smart home stuff and I read it.
Unknown: Could
SPEAKER_00: you get a bigger one?
SPEAKER_00: Could you get a bigger robot vacuum?
SPEAKER_00: It would clean up poo.
SPEAKER_01: You could probably build a poo robot
SPEAKER_01: that would just like take the poo in.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: That one goes first and then that one goes out.
SPEAKER_01: Well, but to be fair, if the dog shits,
SPEAKER_02: I'm pretty sure you'll notice.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, that's what I also think.
SPEAKER_02: You'll pick it up and then it does it in a
SPEAKER_00: corner.
SPEAKER_02: But then to be fair.
SPEAKER_02: That
SPEAKER_01: actually just spreads
SPEAKER_00: it everywhere.
SPEAKER_00: That's
SPEAKER_02: what happens.
SPEAKER_02: I've seen that's what happens.
SPEAKER_02: You can get, I think you can get some of that detect shit.

SPEAKER_01: I think we might have,
SPEAKER_01: I don't know if they were wallabies or kangaroos.
SPEAKER_01: Wallabies are like smaller kangaroos.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but I think they were like decent sized
SPEAKER_02: still, just not like my man, Kangaroo Jack.
SPEAKER_02: They weren't jacked.
SPEAKER_02: They weren't
SPEAKER_01: on the, on the juice.
SPEAKER_01: We saw one kangaroo that looked like he was on the juice.

SPEAKER_02: in the back.
SPEAKER_02: Well, you, so you say you went away
SPEAKER_02: to kind of like match Ethan Vianoff as well,
SPEAKER_02: but then didn't some shoots get canceled?
SPEAKER_02: So you missed them.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So it
SPEAKER_01: did work out that basically the kind of
SPEAKER_01: the Sidemen rule is you book in where in advance
SPEAKER_01: and then we'll fit shoots around it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And it worked out fine.
SPEAKER_01: But then, yeah, there was a hide and seek.
SPEAKER_01: That was the Royal Albert Hall hide and seek
SPEAKER_01: that we were trying to get earlier,
SPEAKER_01: but the only date they could do was while I was away.
SPEAKER_01: So we'll move it.
SPEAKER_01: To be fair, that looked like a lot of fun.
SPEAKER_01: That was one where I walked in the back
SPEAKER_01: and I was like, I've missed out on the part of that.
SPEAKER_01: You know what?
SPEAKER_02: It actually looks better than it sounds,
SPEAKER_02: if you know what I'm saying.
SPEAKER_02: I heard you guys talking about it.
SPEAKER_02: I was like, that's kind of cool.
SPEAKER_02: Then when I was watching you guys,
SPEAKER_02: I was like, actually, that's fucking sick.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Cause there's a lot of places
SPEAKER_01: that you think would be good for a hide and seek.
SPEAKER_01: But actually aren't they need stuff to do.
SPEAKER_01: I'm trying to think what one of them,
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_01: can't think of the top of my head,
SPEAKER_01: but there are a few places
SPEAKER_01: that like sound like they should be cool,
SPEAKER_01: but like, and sometimes we get like big mansions or castles,
SPEAKER_01: but if there's nothing in them,
SPEAKER_01: there's nothing.
SPEAKER_01: The castle that we did it in
SPEAKER_00: was literally just,

SPEAKER_02: and I'm like, wait, is it how long has it ended?
SPEAKER_00: My mic was been on for like another half an hour.
SPEAKER_00: Well, the weird thing was the hide and seek
SPEAKER_00: at Royal Albert Hall was your video.

SPEAKER_02: for a
SPEAKER_00: day.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I was just on my phone just like,
SPEAKER_01: I hope this works.
SPEAKER_02: But can you remember we were on a podcast
SPEAKER_02: and I was going to text Vic,
SPEAKER_02: asking him something,
SPEAKER_02: but I checked the time zones
SPEAKER_02: and he was going to be in bed.
SPEAKER_02: Can you remember what it was?
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, never mind.
SPEAKER_01: You should have texted me anyway,
SPEAKER_01: because time zones,
SPEAKER_01: we were all over the time zone.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: We were out till six, seven, eight.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, so you might have been just
SPEAKER_01: in our time zone still.
SPEAKER_01: We were napping in the evenings.
SPEAKER_01: It was all a bit.
SPEAKER_02: Do you get jet lags usually?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Because Australia is obviously like,
SPEAKER_02: it's almost guaranteed, right?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: You can't
SPEAKER_01: not
SPEAKER_02: get
SPEAKER_01: jet lagged.

SPEAKER_01: They did a $5,000 beer pong tournament
SPEAKER_01: at Lachlan's team power party.
SPEAKER_01: And it was just,
SPEAKER_01: and it was good because it was just,
SPEAKER_01: everyone gets a raffle ticket.
SPEAKER_01: Eight people are randomly drawn
SPEAKER_01: to play in the tournament.
SPEAKER_01: And then there's semifinals and a final.
SPEAKER_01: But it's like,
SPEAKER_01: because there's money on the line,
SPEAKER_01: everyone actually wants to watch.
SPEAKER_01: Like if there's beer pong,
SPEAKER_01: unless there's something on the line
SPEAKER_01: people won't watch.
SPEAKER_01: So yeah, like all like 100 people all around.
SPEAKER_01: We made it to the finals.
SPEAKER_01: It was very intense.
SPEAKER_01: I think it'll be in Lachlan's video at some point.
SPEAKER_01: But it was just, it was good hype.
SPEAKER_01: Fumbled it.
SPEAKER_01: Nearly, it was like, could have gone either way.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, there you go.
SPEAKER_01: Holy crap, that was sick.
SPEAKER_01: They had the middle lit up.
SPEAKER_01: But I was thinking actually,
SPEAKER_01: for a, it's quite cool to have something
SPEAKER_01: like that at a party
SPEAKER_01: because it's like something that everyone watches.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I feel like we should nab that.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: For a sideman party.
SPEAKER_01: They get a sponsor to put up a prize.
SPEAKER_01: They're sponsored by the prize as well.
SPEAKER_01: So it's just like,

SPEAKER_02: He's a very tall man.
SPEAKER_02: She's just got a camera on her head.
SPEAKER_02: Is that her job?
SPEAKER_02: Just talk around and go for it on the watch watch.
SPEAKER_00: Bro, I put you a vlog in your trousers.
SPEAKER_00: I didn't see the phone.
SPEAKER_00: Look at the guy.
SPEAKER_02: That's true.
SPEAKER_02: So Singapore, is that the place that's really safe?
SPEAKER_02: I'm sorry.
SPEAKER_02: And the guy left his laptop there
SPEAKER_02: and went around the whole day
SPEAKER_02: and came back and it was still there.
SPEAKER_02: He was saying that because of cameras,
SPEAKER_02: because of like the penalties,
SPEAKER_02: if you still-
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Oh yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It felt really, really safe.
SPEAKER_01: Like, yeah.

SPEAKER_01: Like
Unknown: -

SPEAKER_01: just in front of him.
SPEAKER_01: And we went into the club, came out like,
SPEAKER_01: like four hours later.
SPEAKER_01: He's still lying there with his phone in front of him.
SPEAKER_01: No shot, man.
SPEAKER_01: No one will take it.
SPEAKER_01: Nice,
SPEAKER_00: nice.
SPEAKER_00: Four hours and no one helped.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he was like-
SPEAKER_00: No one robbed him, but no one helped.
SPEAKER_02: He was not saying like,
SPEAKER_02: yeah, it's really safe, man.
SPEAKER_02: People just passed out.
SPEAKER_02: But their phones are safe.
SPEAKER_02: He went
SPEAKER_00: to help.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, man.
SPEAKER_01: Is it warm there as well?
SPEAKER_01: Yes, very humid though.
SPEAKER_01: It's like, I don't, it was,
SPEAKER_01: do you remember this summer here?
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: It's like that, but even more humid.
SPEAKER_01: Okay,
SPEAKER_02: yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: How was, so then you went to Australia.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: And that's where everyone was.
SPEAKER_01: Kind of, it was, there's like,
SPEAKER_01: there were like 30 of us.
SPEAKER_01: And it was just,
SPEAKER_01: you get a random combination of people everywhere you went.
SPEAKER_01: We just kind of had a group chat
SPEAKER_01: where we put everything we were doing.
SPEAKER_01: And then like some people,
SPEAKER_01: and Australia is so easy.
SPEAKER_01: It's like an hour flight between everywhere.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, nice.
SPEAKER_01: So people are like,
SPEAKER_01: I'll catch you in Melbourne.
SPEAKER_01: I'll go back to Sydney for the week.
SPEAKER_01: And I'll come out to like the Gold Coast,
SPEAKER_01: see you there.
SPEAKER_01: And then it's just,
SPEAKER_01: It sounds fun.
SPEAKER_01: It was very fun.
SPEAKER_01: It was big chilling.
SPEAKER_00: How is it hanging out with like,
SPEAKER_00: you see, obviously you see Rob quite often
SPEAKER_00: and talk to him.
SPEAKER_00: He's local and same.
SPEAKER_00: But everyone else like,
SPEAKER_00: you don't see Preston that much, for example.
SPEAKER_01: No, I haven't seen him in years and years.
SPEAKER_01: But
SPEAKER_00: back in the day,
SPEAKER_00: it was, you had like your group.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: You had the pack and that you talked every day.
SPEAKER_00: And obviously with the Sidemen growing up,
SPEAKER_00: I'm like, now you don't see them.
SPEAKER_00: Do you find it different hanging out with them all now?
SPEAKER_01: No, we're still boys.
SPEAKER_01: We're boys from back in the day.
SPEAKER_00: Is it like exactly how it was kind of thing?
SPEAKER_00: Back in
SPEAKER_01: the day.
SPEAKER_01: Genuinely, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And I feel like both groups came together
SPEAKER_01: in the same way.
SPEAKER_01: Like we all had a hundred YouTubers
SPEAKER_01: we'd record with
SPEAKER_01: and we were like,
SPEAKER_01: these groups of guys, they're the boys.
SPEAKER_01: We want to make videos with them.
SPEAKER_01: Let's make a group together
SPEAKER_01: because we enjoy making videos so much.
SPEAKER_01: So I feel like even like in 10 years time,
SPEAKER_01: like if we weren't making Sidemen videos together,
SPEAKER_01: like we'd still be like, this is the boys.
SPEAKER_01: So no, it was good fun.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, hanging with everyone,
SPEAKER_02: it was good.
Unknown: Well
SPEAKER_00: yeah, we were talking,
SPEAKER_00: me, JJ and Toby were talking about like,
SPEAKER_00: will the Sidemen see each other out of YouTube time?
SPEAKER_00: If you know what I mean?
SPEAKER_00: Like for example, no one's gone and seen Ethan's baby yet.
SPEAKER_00: And admittedly, it's a month old.
SPEAKER_00: It's not really a thing.
SPEAKER_00: She, she is a month old.
SPEAKER_02: I don't always say it and gets hold the fuck off.
SPEAKER_00: She is a month old
SPEAKER_00: and until they're like a year and a half or whatever,
SPEAKER_00: they're just kind of like a blob.
SPEAKER_00: True, true, true, true, true.
SPEAKER_00: But no one's seen her yet.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: Will, is it because of the amount of recording we do
SPEAKER_00: that no one does?
SPEAKER_00: Or is it kind of like,
SPEAKER_00: no one will until.
SPEAKER_00: Are we bad people?
SPEAKER_00: Or are we bad people?
SPEAKER_00: I
SPEAKER_02: think that one is true.
SPEAKER_02: No, no, I think it's both, right?
SPEAKER_02: Like the schedule is mad.
SPEAKER_02: Cause also like, also like,
SPEAKER_02: I think it's also weird to invite yourself around
SPEAKER_02: to like a baby house, right?
SPEAKER_02: You can't.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, you gotta wait for the right time.
SPEAKER_02: But also like, yeah, if you've got a shoot on Tuesday,
SPEAKER_02: you know, Ethan's gonna be there.
SPEAKER_02: You're not really gonna go like, oh, hey, let's go.
SPEAKER_02: You know, but we still try and do the troops meals
SPEAKER_02: now and then.
SPEAKER_02: We need to link up for it.
SPEAKER_01: But I genuinely like, yeah, everyone's so busy.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's like, it's
SPEAKER_00: crazy, crazy, crazy.
SPEAKER_00: I
SPEAKER_02: think when we all like, well,
SPEAKER_02: when everyone slows down,
SPEAKER_02: there'll be more trips that we do.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's the thing.
SPEAKER_01: Cause yeah, like a lot of the guys,
SPEAKER_01: like Lannan, Locky, Rob,
SPEAKER_01: like they're not doing loads and loads of content.
SPEAKER_01: But it's, we still,
SPEAKER_01: and we don't make any content together,
SPEAKER_01: but we still just hang out.
SPEAKER_00: Were you, you've slowed down with content.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: In terms of personal stuff.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: How,
SPEAKER_01: like, how,
Unknown: how
SPEAKER_00: is it?
SPEAKER_00: I don't want to ask you such a,
SPEAKER_00: I don't want to ask you such a basic question,
SPEAKER_00: but obviously like you were doing four videos a day.
SPEAKER_01: Right, four, five, six.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It's hard to do, but I enjoy it.
SPEAKER_01: No, it's, it's nice to, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Chill, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And just not, it's like, I always used to like,
SPEAKER_01: say it was like, you started a stopwatch.
SPEAKER_01: When you're doing daily uploads,
SPEAKER_01: you upload a video, you work,
SPEAKER_01: you upload a video, when you've done that,
SPEAKER_01: you're like, let's say a clock going for the next year.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, it's true, man.
SPEAKER_01: You get caught in that cycle,
SPEAKER_01: and I think it's a good cycle to have,
SPEAKER_01: but I just got to a point where I was just like,
SPEAKER_01: okay, I want to step, step away from this,
SPEAKER_01: just because I wasn't enjoying it much.
SPEAKER_01: After like, among us on Warzone,
SPEAKER_01: there weren't any games that I enjoyed.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So I was like, I'm not going to either pretend
SPEAKER_01: to enjoy a game or sit and make content on a game
SPEAKER_01: I don't enjoy, because then it's,
SPEAKER_01: no, why would anyone watch that?
SPEAKER_01: It doesn't make any sense.
SPEAKER_01: So it just, yeah, didn't, didn't make sense.
SPEAKER_01: And then like, with the cyber and stuff,
SPEAKER_01: we're doing a lot more nowadays.
SPEAKER_01: And I really enjoy that.
SPEAKER_01: And I kind of like being able to put more time
SPEAKER_01: and effort into that.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah,
SPEAKER_02: yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I know you should do a lot of meetings as well.
SPEAKER_02: So it's not like you do just nothing, right?
SPEAKER_02: You go travel, do like meetings and that.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, yes, yes.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: You did a stream recently though,
SPEAKER_02: that like seems just bang, by the way,
SPEAKER_02: like on TikTok.
SPEAKER_02: Like you did a, you did a sponsor stream.
SPEAKER_02: Oh
SPEAKER_01: yeah, it was good of clips.
SPEAKER_01: It was good of clips.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and then after a few weeks,
SPEAKER_00: I was like, fucking hell, bro.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I just did a little fortnight.
SPEAKER_00: That's what you announced you were
SPEAKER_02: getting, right?
SPEAKER_02: And I was like, wow, this guy's farming.
SPEAKER_02: He's taking all my topics from the pocket.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that was good though.
SPEAKER_02: Or you asked a question, did I just button?
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_02: Speaking of warzone, warzone two is around the corner.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: I will jump on.
SPEAKER_01: I will see how it goes.
SPEAKER_01: But from what I've seen,
SPEAKER_01: it doesn't look different enough to warzone.
SPEAKER_01: Like we need something fresh and new,
SPEAKER_01: like the level that what, you know,
SPEAKER_01: fortnight was to pubg, warzone was to fortnight,
SPEAKER_01: that new wave.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we need that area, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But I
SPEAKER_01: feel
SPEAKER_02: like, like fortnight is still,
SPEAKER_02: with the no build mode,
SPEAKER_02: it's still like somewhat playable.
SPEAKER_02: I feel like still people have gone a lot,
SPEAKER_02: whereas I feel like fortnight has continued
SPEAKER_02: its relevancy somewhat.
SPEAKER_02: Whereas warzone just feels like it's empty now.
SPEAKER_02: It's like a ghost town.
SPEAKER_02: I know people stream every day,
SPEAKER_02: but like,
SPEAKER_02: 50,000 people used to grow it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, like, now it's a ghost town.
SPEAKER_02: Everyone's just waiting for warzone two.
SPEAKER_02: We're also, I remember everyone's waiting
SPEAKER_02: for Caldera, the new map,
SPEAKER_02: and then a week later,
SPEAKER_02: everyone's pretending they liked it.
SPEAKER_02: I was like, bro, this is really fun.
SPEAKER_02: And then like, I just stopped playing.
Unknown: I'm
SPEAKER_00: like, bro, bring them back.
SPEAKER_00: I think warzone two is gonna be the same.
SPEAKER_00: Everyone's gonna be like,
SPEAKER_00: say, new warzone.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, two weeks.
SPEAKER_01: Do you know, I think the biggest issue
SPEAKER_01: is that it won't reestablish your skill gap.
SPEAKER_01: What makes a game hype, exciting, and big
SPEAKER_01: is a skill gap.
SPEAKER_01: The start of fortnight,
SPEAKER_01: no one knew what they were doing.
SPEAKER_01: You build your little two by two.
SPEAKER_01: Someone works out how to do like a wall rap.
SPEAKER_01: And it's like, oh, that's nuts.
SPEAKER_01: It's like, I'm gonna learn to do that.
SPEAKER_01: And then I'm gonna win the fights.
SPEAKER_01: And it was like that.
SPEAKER_01: And then with warzone, it was like,
SPEAKER_01: oh, I'm gonna learn these guns are good.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, if you slide cancel, you can get around faster.
SPEAKER_01: If you lean on these walls,
SPEAKER_01: you can do better if you do this kind of stuff.
SPEAKER_01: If you spam UAVs,
SPEAKER_01: you're gonna be able to get loads of kills.
SPEAKER_01: But when everyone knows it, it's not fun.
SPEAKER_01: And when everyone practices it,
SPEAKER_01: everyone gets so good.
SPEAKER_01: It's like, it's not as exciting.
SPEAKER_01: So I feel like warzone two,
SPEAKER_01: it's gonna be mechanically very similar.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And also for like warzone was like a town in a place.
SPEAKER_02: Because of lockdown and COVID,
SPEAKER_02: everyone was kind of like nonstop playing it.
SPEAKER_02: So it's more like the moment in town that we all miss,
SPEAKER_02: not necessarily the game.
SPEAKER_02: If the game still existed now in Verdance,
SPEAKER_02: I don't think it still would be what it was.
SPEAKER_02: Same as Among Us.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Like Among Us was the like, it was the lockdown game.
SPEAKER_00: Everyone enjoyed it for a little bit now.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, we could literally play it.
SPEAKER_00: We still enjoy it for the more time.
SPEAKER_00: I'm so glad
SPEAKER_01: we're able to keep it alive
SPEAKER_01: because it is such a content platform.
SPEAKER_02: It's because the lobbies are so bad though.
SPEAKER_02: Like our lobby is awful when we play.
SPEAKER_02: That's why it's good.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the good lobbies were always boring.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, when people got good at the game,
SPEAKER_02: it's got really boring.
SPEAKER_02: I've just, I've checked you've done like upload
SPEAKER_02: for like two points, three seconds instead of two.
SPEAKER_02: Like bro.
SPEAKER_02: But I used to be,
SPEAKER_00: I just used to lie about that stuff.
SPEAKER_00: I used to go like, are you in did that for a second?
SPEAKER_00: But it actually takes like 1.5 seconds.
SPEAKER_00: And they go, oh, you're a little nerd.
SPEAKER_00: And I was like, I was lying.
SPEAKER_01: Have you set up with enough
SPEAKER_02: confidence?
SPEAKER_02: I love you always get like,
SPEAKER_02: if you're high level as well, you get fucked.
SPEAKER_02: Well, because of the mod
SPEAKER_00: ones we do now,
SPEAKER_00: Ethan got modded to like level 65.
SPEAKER_00: And I'm only level 18.
Unknown: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So now I can't be voted out just for level.
SPEAKER_02: But I remember how long that last one was took to get going.
SPEAKER_02: Oh no.
SPEAKER_02: That's not the mod.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Cause I was not in that episode,
SPEAKER_02: but I was in two of the recordings
SPEAKER_02: cause we never actually got
SPEAKER_01: it
Unknown: done.
SPEAKER_01: I'll tell you what,
SPEAKER_01: trying to install gaming mods with people
SPEAKER_01: that don't know how to use computers.
SPEAKER_01: People that don't know how to actually not,
SPEAKER_01: I'm not going to,
SPEAKER_01: I was about to say people who can't install windows.
SPEAKER_01: JJ was actually, all right.
SPEAKER_01: JJ was one of the better ones.
SPEAKER_01: Oh no, no, no.
SPEAKER_01: We'll call him out.
SPEAKER_01: Theo Baker.
SPEAKER_00: Theo Baker doesn't know how to use,
SPEAKER_00: like he was like, okay,
SPEAKER_00: so now do I need to turn my PC on?
Unknown: And then he got hacked.
SPEAKER_02: It's who started, he actually got physically hacked
SPEAKER_02: and still beat me.
SPEAKER_02: What the hell?
SPEAKER_02: He still beat me even though he was getting hacked.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: There's a lot of fun stuff you can do in gaming
SPEAKER_01: with modded stuff,
SPEAKER_01: but just trying to set it up and make it work.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: That's the issue.
SPEAKER_00: That's, as much as I enjoy how bad our lobby is,
SPEAKER_00: it's almost getting to the point where it's too bad
SPEAKER_00: that I said like,
SPEAKER_00: can we introduce a sheriff role?
SPEAKER_00: Where all it is is one person can try and kill the imposter
SPEAKER_00: and if they get it wrong, they die instead.
SPEAKER_02: That's it.
SPEAKER_02: Try to explain.
SPEAKER_02: Larry was
SPEAKER_00: like, don't really understand it.
SPEAKER_00: I don't want to play that.
SPEAKER_00: It sounds too complicated.
SPEAKER_00: And JJ went, yeah, no, I don't like that.
SPEAKER_00: I don't understand it.
SPEAKER_02: Also, our attention span, this is such an easy world.
SPEAKER_02: When we go to the other map,
SPEAKER_02: everyone's attention span just dies.
SPEAKER_02: Like we played the regular map, was it Skrulls?
SPEAKER_02: The Skrulls.
SPEAKER_02: Skrulls.
SPEAKER_02: And we go to the polis.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And everyone's like, no, I can't play this game anymore.
SPEAKER_02: But
SPEAKER_01: Skrulls
SPEAKER_00: is so small.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but
SPEAKER_01: it's just classic man.
SPEAKER_01: You ever take the walk to polis?
SPEAKER_01: Oh my God.
SPEAKER_01: I actually liked that a lot.
SPEAKER_01: I actually really enjoyed that.
SPEAKER_01: I know as soon
SPEAKER_00: as we play polis again, I'm seeing that.
SPEAKER_00: I want that.
SPEAKER_00: I think
SPEAKER_01: we should actually,
SPEAKER_01: I saw a lot of comments saying
SPEAKER_01: the new Sidemen house map is cool,
SPEAKER_01: but it's too big.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we've done it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we should just take the custom skins and go back.
SPEAKER_01: Or we could even get,
SPEAKER_01: we should actually, we should request a custom polis.
SPEAKER_01: So it's a polis, but with a Sidemen theming like that.
SPEAKER_01: That would be cool.
SPEAKER_01: We should have that made just as-
SPEAKER_01: We need to
SPEAKER_00: do prox as well.
SPEAKER_00: Everyone is screaming prox.
SPEAKER_00: I'm traumatized
SPEAKER_01: by proximity.
SPEAKER_01: He used to crash my computer.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, did it?
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: He used to crash my computer.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, it did?
SPEAKER_02: I remember this shit all the time.
SPEAKER_02: It did.
SPEAKER_01: And I would keep rejoining the lobby
SPEAKER_01: like every second game in a half.
SPEAKER_01: And I'd be trying to stream
SPEAKER_01: so my whole stream would end.
SPEAKER_01: I remember this.
SPEAKER_01: That was dramatic.
SPEAKER_01: I come traumatized by that mod.
SPEAKER_01: That
SPEAKER_00: mod is so, it's so good though.
SPEAKER_00: The moment where you find JJ.
SPEAKER_00: JJ, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And JJ's like, like, like, oh shit.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, shit.
SPEAKER_00: That moment is goaded.
SPEAKER_02: I feel like it's nice because like,
SPEAKER_02: JJ really enjoys it as well.
SPEAKER_02: You can tell when he's in it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And that's always nice to see.
SPEAKER_02: It's a good game, man.
SPEAKER_02: It's a very good like concept,
SPEAKER_02: but it's just, yeah, people took it too serious.
SPEAKER_02: I remember when we used to play with Talia,
SPEAKER_02: then it got to a point where she hated our lobby.
SPEAKER_02: Oh yeah.
SPEAKER_02: No, she won't
SPEAKER_00: play with us.
SPEAKER_00: She likes to play like, she's like,
SPEAKER_00: why would you troll?
SPEAKER_02: She's
SPEAKER_00: like, why would you not want to try and win?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Something like that.
SPEAKER_02: That's enough for me.
SPEAKER_02: We just vote someone out.
SPEAKER_02: Some people just talking it voted out.
SPEAKER_02: No reason.
SPEAKER_02: JJ says something.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, man.
SPEAKER_02: Why are you washed?
SPEAKER_02: The most
SPEAKER_00: recent video is actually,
SPEAKER_00: oh, Vic talks a lot when he's in pasta.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Vote him out and he's out.
SPEAKER_00: Was it you as well?
SPEAKER_00: No.
SPEAKER_00: No,
SPEAKER_01: that was
SPEAKER_00: the
SPEAKER_01: worst part.
SPEAKER_01: I feel like I talk a lot all of the time.
SPEAKER_00: Well, there was only three.
SPEAKER_00: It was only like you and two people left.
SPEAKER_00: It
SPEAKER_01: was me, Toby, Viz and Jamie.
SPEAKER_00: Four.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so four and it was, I think it was Jamie.
SPEAKER_00: And Toby
SPEAKER_01: was like, Vic, what happened?
SPEAKER_01: I explained exactly what happened.
SPEAKER_01: You're talking a lot.
SPEAKER_01: I voted out.
SPEAKER_01: I was like, why?
SPEAKER_02: Remember when Toby played me with a sympathy card once?
SPEAKER_02: Oh, you always say it's me, man.
SPEAKER_02: You always say it's me.
SPEAKER_02: He did that recently.
SPEAKER_02: He did that recently.
SPEAKER_02: And it was him.
SPEAKER_02: I
SPEAKER_01: know, man.
SPEAKER_02: And also Ethan, that's the memorable moment
SPEAKER_02: where he's like, ha, Simon, I got you.
SPEAKER_02: I got you.
SPEAKER_02: Finally.
SPEAKER_02: That was
SPEAKER_01: incredible.
SPEAKER_01: He was burning.
SPEAKER_01: He was burning after
SPEAKER_02: that one.
SPEAKER_02: He was, he was.
SPEAKER_02: But obviously Warzone had the, going back to Warzone now.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the Warzone Wednesdays, which was huge for you.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.

SPEAKER_02: Warzone Wednesdays.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_00: But Warzone Wednesdays, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, Warzone Wednesdays, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: But Warzone Wednesdays stopped.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: True, true.
SPEAKER_02: That was the best tournament still though,
SPEAKER_02: even by like structure, man.
SPEAKER_02: It was.
SPEAKER_00: Minecraft Monday
SPEAKER_01: was kind of
SPEAKER_00: lit though.
SPEAKER_00: Minecraft Monday was good.
SPEAKER_00: Minecraft Monday was good.
SPEAKER_01: Fortnite Fridays was sick.
SPEAKER_01: And it's because I got bullied in Fortnite Fridays.
SPEAKER_01: When Warzone Wednesday came up,
SPEAKER_01: I was like, it's not a game.
SPEAKER_01: It's not a game now.
SPEAKER_01: I remember
SPEAKER_02: when you played with like Wars or Jukeys, right?
SPEAKER_02: You'd be like the brains of the general
SPEAKER_02: and they just go and fucking like.
SPEAKER_01: Squad capital.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, the growl.
SPEAKER_01: What a beautiful gun.
SPEAKER_01: How's that go on?
SPEAKER_01: This is such a sick time.
SPEAKER_01: No, you know what?
SPEAKER_01: I really watched on my flight back from Australia.
SPEAKER_01: I had so much time to kill.
SPEAKER_01: I was just watching some of these.
SPEAKER_01: Absolutely.
SPEAKER_01: And I was just like, oh man, I miss it.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I remember we used to watch them.
SPEAKER_00: Like everyone's just typing in the chat,
SPEAKER_00: like, oh, they've just done this, done this.
SPEAKER_00: And then you always got brought out cookies.
SPEAKER_01: They were, I mean,
SPEAKER_01: did you drop a donation for no reason?
SPEAKER_01: They were, they were epic gamer
SPEAKER_02: moments.
SPEAKER_02: But yeah, it was
SPEAKER_01: also at the same time,
SPEAKER_01: like I would wake up, eat,
SPEAKER_01: stream for like six hours,

SPEAKER_01: Like what's that?
SPEAKER_01: Battle Royale's.
SPEAKER_01: We need a halo.
SPEAKER_01: We need a halo battle.
SPEAKER_01: It's a whole new universe,
SPEAKER_01: whole new set of skills,
SPEAKER_01: whole new weapons, vehicles, everything.
SPEAKER_01: That's what we need.
SPEAKER_01: We need someone to do it.
SPEAKER_00: Do you think the Sidemen should do a tournament ever
SPEAKER_00: of like, we're not in it.
SPEAKER_00: We're just like,
SPEAKER_00: you can see how Warzone Wednesday was Keems, right?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Like that, but Sidemen won.
SPEAKER_00: The next time a game pops off.
SPEAKER_00: We should.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Honestly,
SPEAKER_01: we should.
SPEAKER_01: Cause yeah, you get,
SPEAKER_01: we can pump the viewership so much.
SPEAKER_01: You get crazy sponsors.
SPEAKER_01: It could be like a way bigger prize pool.
Unknown: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Well, there you go.
SPEAKER_00: It's coming.
SPEAKER_02: We just need a game.
SPEAKER_02: What's going on?
SPEAKER_02: Where are the games, man?
SPEAKER_02: I
SPEAKER_01: feel like it has to be a Battle Royale game.
SPEAKER_01: It does.
SPEAKER_01: Just like, like competitive Overwatch,
SPEAKER_01: competitive Valorant.
SPEAKER_01: Like I just don't care when they respawn.
SPEAKER_01: It doesn't have the same build.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Like H1Z1, like PUBG.
SPEAKER_01: Like when you're watching that person,
SPEAKER_01: who's been sweating for 20 minutes,
SPEAKER_01: just trying to win every gunfight, every 50-50,
SPEAKER_01: they've won like 12 of them in a row.
SPEAKER_01: And it comes down to that.
SPEAKER_01: It's that build is so entertaining.
SPEAKER_01: We need it.
SPEAKER_01: But it's crazy because it can be the same game.
SPEAKER_01: Like it could be literally Caldera,
SPEAKER_01: but people just don't care in the same way.
SPEAKER_01: It's not as exciting.
SPEAKER_00: Well, you were talking about like your PC breaking and stuff.
SPEAKER_00: That was at your flat, right?
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: Now you're in a house.
SPEAKER_01: Same PC, I think.
SPEAKER_01: It's the same one now?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. Well, then prox might not happen.
SPEAKER_00: Well,
SPEAKER_02: that's just to be fair,
SPEAKER_02: the mod has probably changed so much.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's really easy now.
SPEAKER_02: We'll give it a run.
SPEAKER_00: But you're living in a house.
SPEAKER_00: I am.
SPEAKER_00: How is it?
SPEAKER_00: It's...
SPEAKER_00: Because he's now living in a house.
SPEAKER_00: It's nice.
SPEAKER_00: Barely, though.
SPEAKER_00: But he is off.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, I thought
SPEAKER_02: you were making a joke
SPEAKER_02: of how small my house is.
SPEAKER_02: No.
Unknown: Like
SPEAKER_02: barely.
SPEAKER_02: Have
SPEAKER_00: you caught a house or like you moved?
Unknown: You
SPEAKER_00: moved and you moved.
SPEAKER_00: I literally have
SPEAKER_02: stayed maybe like six nights
SPEAKER_02: from my house.
SPEAKER_02: It's actually even bad.
SPEAKER_02: Wait, what?
SPEAKER_02: Are you always down here?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I've been traveling London.
SPEAKER_02: I went away to America as well.
SPEAKER_02: Are you overlapping
SPEAKER_01: your flat and your house
SPEAKER_01: or are you keeping both?
SPEAKER_02: No, the flat's gone.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: I was going to, but I got advised
SPEAKER_02: by my accountants to not do that
SPEAKER_02: because I do hotels instead
SPEAKER_02: because of business costs.
SPEAKER_02: Smart, write it off.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: He literally moved and then like four days later
SPEAKER_00: went away for a week,
SPEAKER_00: came back for like five days,
SPEAKER_00: went away for a week.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So.
SPEAKER_02: And that's annoying because I've got like,
SPEAKER_02: there's a desk over there
SPEAKER_02: that I'm being set up.
SPEAKER_02: This could be like a little...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So my plan was to have a studio here
SPEAKER_02: for streaming and music.
SPEAKER_02: So when I traveled here,
SPEAKER_02: nothing changes.
SPEAKER_02: So it's just the same.
SPEAKER_02: But then like,
SPEAKER_02: we moved the podcast studio as well.
SPEAKER_02: The same time I moved house.
SPEAKER_02: So it's just been really annoying
SPEAKER_02: to get everything organized.
SPEAKER_02: And even my house is now still full of boxes.
SPEAKER_02: Like we've got one of the spare rooms.
SPEAKER_02: It's probably, you can't even get into it.
SPEAKER_02: I cleared
SPEAKER_01: out a load of boxes today.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I'm still going through boxes.
SPEAKER_01: It's just, it be that way.
SPEAKER_02: How's it been living in the house?
SPEAKER_01: No, it's nice.
SPEAKER_01: I really enjoy it.
SPEAKER_01: It's peaceful.
SPEAKER_01: It's like,
SPEAKER_01: actually one thing that I spent,
SPEAKER_01: when I come into London now,
SPEAKER_01: it's so busy.
SPEAKER_01: I didn't realize how much of a blessing it was in lockdown.
SPEAKER_01: Get across London, no traffic.
SPEAKER_01: Walk through central London.
SPEAKER_01: What do you
SPEAKER_00: mean get across London?
SPEAKER_00: Where were you going in lockdown?
SPEAKER_01: So Sidemen's shoes.
SPEAKER_01: We were allowed as well.
SPEAKER_01: We didn't have any,
SPEAKER_00: bro.
SPEAKER_00: We're not in lockdown.
SPEAKER_00: Not on one way.
SPEAKER_00: You're not allowed to work.
SPEAKER_00: The one way
SPEAKER_01: we were allowed to work.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: The rule of six.
SPEAKER_01: Where we went and did a muck bang
SPEAKER_01: and sat three meters away from each
SPEAKER_02: other.
SPEAKER_02: I'll admit, one day in lockdown one,
SPEAKER_02: I did go to JJ's.
SPEAKER_01: I'm telling the government.
SPEAKER_01: He can.
SPEAKER_01: He just did.
SPEAKER_01: It was one of them
SPEAKER_02: ones where like,
SPEAKER_02: no one really got the rules.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, I didn't believe it.
SPEAKER_02: I'm like, sure you're not.
SPEAKER_02: Like, sure you can still go out.
SPEAKER_02: And then I went, I got a cab, right?
SPEAKER_02: And there's no one in London at all.
SPEAKER_02: I thought the only guy I was like,
SPEAKER_02: shit, maybe I should have stayed at home.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe I should have followed the rules now.
SPEAKER_02: Fuck me.
SPEAKER_02: It's fine.
SPEAKER_02: You can leave that.
SPEAKER_02: I don't care.
SPEAKER_02: It
SPEAKER_01: was a very dystopian time.
SPEAKER_01: I remember I was sat in a park once
SPEAKER_01: and someone came up and they're like,
SPEAKER_01: are you doing your hour of exercise?
SPEAKER_01: I'm just sat on my own in the park.
SPEAKER_01: I guess I'll walk in a circle.
SPEAKER_01: It's like, how crazy is that?
SPEAKER_01: A police officer asked me,
SPEAKER_01: why are we just sat by a tree outside?
SPEAKER_01: You
SPEAKER_02: should get one of those hand exercises.
SPEAKER_02: Just sit there doing this.
SPEAKER_02: Do you ever see
SPEAKER_00: the one of like,
SPEAKER_00: like 20 guys just on this street
SPEAKER_00: and a policeman comes up and they just start like,
Unknown: hi
SPEAKER_01: nice everyone.
SPEAKER_00: Hi nice.
SPEAKER_00: That's
SPEAKER_02: enough.
SPEAKER_02: It was a weird time, wasn't it?
SPEAKER_02: Looking back, it's so strange.
SPEAKER_02: I remember talking to you and JJ about it
SPEAKER_02: because that was when we would do the podcast
SPEAKER_02: and record music for him in that
SPEAKER_00: room.
SPEAKER_02: And it was like, oh, 60 people either died
SPEAKER_02: or got it or something.
SPEAKER_02: And then I remember it was being like nine.
SPEAKER_02: It's not gonna happen.
SPEAKER_02: It's not gonna shut down things.
SPEAKER_02: And then literally like a month later,
SPEAKER_01: gone.
SPEAKER_01: I remember I was supposed to go to Miami for Miami Ultra
SPEAKER_01: and there's all these headlines
SPEAKER_01: and surely they're just causing a scene,
SPEAKER_01: gassing it up.
SPEAKER_01: Headlines gotta be headlines.
SPEAKER_01: And then literally the week before,
SPEAKER_01: they were like boarded the shot.
SPEAKER_01: I'm like, pain.
SPEAKER_02: I think cause it's for us in our generation,
SPEAKER_02: especially in the UK, not in the rest of the world.
SPEAKER_02: There's never really been any like,
SPEAKER_02: we hear about big news stories,
SPEAKER_02: like hurricanes, tsunamis, pandemics,
SPEAKER_02: but never really in the UK
SPEAKER_02: have had anything wrong yourself.
SPEAKER_02: So like when you read headlines,
SPEAKER_02: you still think it's fake or like it's just a headline.
SPEAKER_02: So you're like, oh, COVID, just on the news,
SPEAKER_02: but probably it was real.
SPEAKER_02: It became very real, man.
SPEAKER_00: Well, like me, JJ, you and Josh all moved into London.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: Like scammed.
SPEAKER_00: Literally, like you got out of the house
SPEAKER_00: like two months earlier than us, I think.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so
SPEAKER_01: I had one win for it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: You were out of it.
SPEAKER_00: And then we move into London
SPEAKER_00: and it's literally like a month later, locked down.
SPEAKER_00: And it just became like pointless.
SPEAKER_00: I
SPEAKER_01: did enjoy though, just walking around London.
SPEAKER_01: Like I walked, I remember I walked all the way
SPEAKER_01: from like down the River Thames,
SPEAKER_01: past London Eye, past the House of Parliament,
SPEAKER_01: back around down the other side of the river, walked home.
SPEAKER_01: And I didn't see one single person.
SPEAKER_01: That was the first week where it was like,
SPEAKER_01: stay inside, do not go outside.
SPEAKER_01: And as I was walking, I was like,
SPEAKER_01: this will never happen again in my entire life.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I remember thinking that.
SPEAKER_02: And it got annoying as well when everything came back
SPEAKER_02: because it like ruined London because it's so beautiful.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And now it's just fucking...
SPEAKER_01: It was, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: There were parts of London that were peaceful.
SPEAKER_01: Anywhere I go in London now, it's just like...
SPEAKER_01: You keep your head down.
SPEAKER_01: You keep your head
SPEAKER_02: down, you can't even look anymore.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Whereas back then it was like perspective and stuff.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: We went and just looked at loads of old buildings.
SPEAKER_01: Like that's all you could do.
SPEAKER_01: You would just go and walk and look at things.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's
SPEAKER_00: gonna happen.
SPEAKER_00: Happens all the time.
SPEAKER_02: I don't usually leave in.
Unknown: Yeah.
Unknown: It
SPEAKER_00: stops in like 10 seconds.
Unknown: If
SPEAKER_01: you're Charlie Puth, you'd remix that.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah,
SPEAKER_02: yeah.
SPEAKER_02: See my name?
SPEAKER_00: And...
SPEAKER_00: Stop.
SPEAKER_00: Wait, before it's actually a lot off.
SPEAKER_01: It's just about as cool.
SPEAKER_01: The floor's getting kind of hot.
SPEAKER_00: This is going on a bit long now.
SPEAKER_00: I'm starting to worry.
Unknown: Is that
SPEAKER_00: number four?
Unknown: No,
SPEAKER_00: sure.
SPEAKER_02: There we go.
SPEAKER_00: There we go.
Unknown: And...
Unknown: Nice.
SPEAKER_02: Class.
SPEAKER_00: We've had that in side cast before, haven't we?
SPEAKER_00: Really?
Unknown: Yeah,
SPEAKER_00: me and JJ went on a jog down Oxford Street
SPEAKER_00: and it was literally, we saw six people.
SPEAKER_00: But it was literally, you're going down the busiest street in London.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And there's six people.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's mad.
SPEAKER_00: It was good.
SPEAKER_00: Good
SPEAKER_01: times.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But I can't
SPEAKER_00: wait to move into my house.
SPEAKER_00: I'm like, I keep seeing, I feel like all of us
SPEAKER_00: was so gasped to move into London.
SPEAKER_00: And we're like, yeah, I want to live in central London
SPEAKER_00: and experience all of that.
SPEAKER_00: And now everyone just can't wait to be out of it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: We did get scammed though.
SPEAKER_00: Like,
SPEAKER_02: you're all right.
SPEAKER_02: So like, it did feel very like...
SPEAKER_02: Although,
SPEAKER_01: yeah.
SPEAKER_01: At the same time though, actually,
SPEAKER_01: it was kind of great for delivery food.
SPEAKER_01: True.
SPEAKER_01: I lived off like, Wickers restaurants were shut.
SPEAKER_01: Like, so all you could do was order and food.
SPEAKER_01: So I could just order and food nonstop, stream nonstop.
SPEAKER_01: So I can't complain too much.
SPEAKER_01: I mean,
SPEAKER_00: it was great for like our career.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, for us.
SPEAKER_01: It was a good place to be, I think, actually.
SPEAKER_00: Although, if we were in the house for lockdown,
SPEAKER_00: it would have been lit.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, true.
SPEAKER_00: Because we had a garden.
SPEAKER_00: We had a pool.
SPEAKER_00: We had a gym.
SPEAKER_01: Content would have been nonsense.
SPEAKER_01: But I would have been literally like,
SPEAKER_01: let's film some videos on board.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I think we would have...
SPEAKER_00: I mean, yeah, both worked out kind of for us.
Unknown: We
SPEAKER_01: should have made more Sidemen gaming videos
SPEAKER_01: during lockdown.
SPEAKER_01: What will we do?
SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think back, what will we actually do?
Unknown: We
SPEAKER_00: were just streaming.
SPEAKER_00: It was...
SPEAKER_00: Everyone was streaming.
SPEAKER_00: But we should have
SPEAKER_01: just streamed games together
SPEAKER_01: and recorded it.
SPEAKER_02: True.
SPEAKER_02: It's kind of good though.
SPEAKER_02: In a way, like, actually, the first one,
SPEAKER_02: I mean, everyone kind of says the first one felt good.
SPEAKER_02: Obviously, it was bad, like, for the world.
SPEAKER_02: But like...
SPEAKER_02: No, I mean, I agree.
SPEAKER_02: I know what you mean.
SPEAKER_02: Because you just wake up and just fucking game all day
SPEAKER_02: and not feel bad.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Because the thing is, you'd feel bad, right?
SPEAKER_02: You'd say, oh, I should probably do something properly now.
SPEAKER_02: Before you would never do it, man.
SPEAKER_02: Just go for it.
SPEAKER_02: It's like, sick.
SPEAKER_02: But yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But the house has been good.
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: It's very nice.
SPEAKER_02: Have you still got rooms that you don't use?
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: And how does that feel?
SPEAKER_02: Because for me, that's kind of like weird, like...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Because also, I'm slowly filling in the furniture.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not rushing it.
SPEAKER_02: I don't need to get everything done.
SPEAKER_02: So like, some places are just still empty.
SPEAKER_02: It's really weird.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, there's
SPEAKER_01: a few empty rooms, but it was good
SPEAKER_01: because we had loads of people staying with us,
SPEAKER_01: like around...
SPEAKER_01: Why did everyone come here?
SPEAKER_01: Just at one point...
SPEAKER_01: Charity match and boxing.
SPEAKER_00: Did you just boxing?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Or charity match?
SPEAKER_01: It was not.
SPEAKER_01: It was because we went to Tomorrowland.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: And it also happened to...
SPEAKER_01: Because that's when Lachlan came, Rob came.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Some of Ellie's friends from overseas came.
SPEAKER_01: Nice.
SPEAKER_01: And like, we had like a full house.
SPEAKER_01: It was...
SPEAKER_01: Long time, right?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And then Lannan just stayed because he couldn't get a visa.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, he's been here for ages, right?
SPEAKER_01: He came back and forth.
SPEAKER_01: He was here.
SPEAKER_01: He was here for about...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he's not here now.
SPEAKER_01: No, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_01: It was good to go and see him.
SPEAKER_01: I was like, I'm staying at your house now.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, true, true.
SPEAKER_01: In my
SPEAKER_00: head, your house, like...
SPEAKER_00: Because you know you did your house tour?
SPEAKER_00: Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00: And it was quite empty at that point.
SPEAKER_00: In my house, in my head, it's still that.
SPEAKER_00: It's still fair.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Obviously.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: No, there's like 25% done.
SPEAKER_01: It's getting there.
SPEAKER_01: It's a very...
SPEAKER_01: We've been quite meh, getting it done.
SPEAKER_01: It's one of those things where it's just...
SPEAKER_01: You just kind of like, you forget to follow up on stuff
SPEAKER_01: and then just nothing happens.
SPEAKER_02: Well, it's because you live in the parts that you live in.
SPEAKER_02: That's it.
SPEAKER_02: And like, you don't need the stuff necessarily.
SPEAKER_02: You just need to look good.
SPEAKER_02: Or if you have guests around and stuff.
SPEAKER_02: So it's like, I don't need a sofa just for the room.
SPEAKER_02: I don't go in it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But it looks weird without one.
SPEAKER_01: I would say everything is functional.
SPEAKER_01: The full house is functional.
SPEAKER_01: But in terms of decoration and like filling spaces.
SPEAKER_01: It's still a long way.
SPEAKER_01: Cause I was supposed to do a video like this year.
SPEAKER_01: I was like, this is everything I've done.
SPEAKER_01: It's like, that was last summer.
SPEAKER_01: Like a new house tour.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: A new house tour.
SPEAKER_01: I'm like, maybe next year.
SPEAKER_01: Give me another year.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Well, you've got your gym.
SPEAKER_00: The gym is fully done.
SPEAKER_00: The gym.
SPEAKER_00: I'm very, very happy
SPEAKER_01: with that.
SPEAKER_01: I spend, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: A lot of time in there.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Instead of making videos.
SPEAKER_01: I'm just in the gym.
SPEAKER_01: In the gym, man.
SPEAKER_00: In the gym.
SPEAKER_00: It does look really sick.
SPEAKER_00: I remember watching that video.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: It's really,
SPEAKER_01: it's nice as well.
SPEAKER_01: Cause it's a, I just enjoy being there.
SPEAKER_01: So like, I can go and spend like two hours just like sat in there.
SPEAKER_01: Just like being really lazy and slow with my workout.
SPEAKER_01: But it's just somewhere I want to be.
SPEAKER_01: Like put some music, turn down the lights.
Unknown: Cause
SPEAKER_02: you feel sometimes for me, like going to the gym is always like the
SPEAKER_02: long part.
SPEAKER_02: Like actually getting out and going.
SPEAKER_02: And it's
SPEAKER_01: finding the gap in the day.
SPEAKER_01: Like, so sometimes you'll think, right, I've got 50 minutes.
SPEAKER_01: It's going to take me 10 minutes to get to the gym.
SPEAKER_01: Then 10 minutes to get back.
SPEAKER_01: So then I'll have 30 minutes to gym.
SPEAKER_01: What's the point?
SPEAKER_01: Where it's like, I can kind of be like working on stuff.
SPEAKER_01: Like if I know I've got a delivery coming or something.
SPEAKER_01: I'll be like, right, I'm going to go and start my workout.
SPEAKER_01: I'll stop for five minutes in the middle.
SPEAKER_01: Go back to it.
SPEAKER_02: My dad's currently putting my gym floor in my garage.
SPEAKER_00: Damn.
SPEAKER_02: Labor.
SPEAKER_02: But also gym equipment is way more offensive than I thought it was.
SPEAKER_01: Oh yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It went up during lockdown.
SPEAKER_01: I feel like it's been up during lockdown.
SPEAKER_01: So many people wanted home gym equipment.
SPEAKER_01: The prices went up and they just left the prices.
SPEAKER_01: They're just like, you know, you're right.
SPEAKER_01: We're kind of rich now.
SPEAKER_01: Leave the prices up.
SPEAKER_02: Is that the AC?
SPEAKER_02: Even the AC is cool coordinated.
SPEAKER_01: It was white.
SPEAKER_01: They wrapped it.
SPEAKER_01: That's rad.
SPEAKER_02: That's so sick, man.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But the treadmill was like three grand.
SPEAKER_02: I'm like, fuck, man.
Unknown: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I still have the one Simon bought me.
SPEAKER_01: That was
SPEAKER_02: a Simon video.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And I
SPEAKER_01: still haven't activated the Peloton membership.
SPEAKER_01: I don't want it.
SPEAKER_01: I just want to run.
SPEAKER_01: True.
SPEAKER_02: I was thinking that.
SPEAKER_02: I was looking at the different between Peloton and regular one.
SPEAKER_02: I'm like, am I just paying for the bloke to tell me what to do?
SPEAKER_01: I personally, I just don't.
SPEAKER_01: I just want, but it has a setting where you just press just run.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And you can set the incline and speed.
SPEAKER_01: And that's all I want to do.
SPEAKER_01: I stick an iPad.
SPEAKER_01: It has this massive screen.
SPEAKER_01: And I just have an iPad on the massive screen.
SPEAKER_01: With like whatever I'm watching on it.
SPEAKER_02: But I'm like,
SPEAKER_01: it's crazy.
SPEAKER_01: It's like an exp...
SPEAKER_01: It's one of the most expensive treadmills.
SPEAKER_01: And then you pay them like 40 quid a month or something on top.
SPEAKER_01: I swear it's a scam.
SPEAKER_01: But the thing is other people are like, yeah, I love how I do the classes.
SPEAKER_01: That's the thing.
SPEAKER_01: I know that Conn does,
SPEAKER_00: I think.
SPEAKER_00: Conn said that he uses like the other stuff,
SPEAKER_00: like he'll just put it onto the TV,
SPEAKER_00: like a different TV and do the classes.
SPEAKER_02: It's a different treadmill type thing.
SPEAKER_00: No, no.
SPEAKER_00: So you can literally do like a yoga class on a different TV.
SPEAKER_00: All right.
SPEAKER_00: So I think it is worth it.
SPEAKER_00: If you...
SPEAKER_00: If that
SPEAKER_01: is how you work out,
SPEAKER_01: but for me, I'm just...
SPEAKER_01: If you want to just run.
SPEAKER_01: I live here.
SPEAKER_01: There's no point.
SPEAKER_01: That's it.
SPEAKER_00: Well, speaking of Simon videos.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: The video that went out.
SPEAKER_00: This is next week.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So.
SPEAKER_00: Young versus old just went out.
SPEAKER_01: Young guns.
SPEAKER_00: Me and Vic were on the young team.
SPEAKER_00: You haven't seen it because it's not out yet.
SPEAKER_01: I've seen some clips.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Of the old team.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: We were on the young team and it started off a bit stinky.
SPEAKER_00: We went to kids zone.
SPEAKER_00: Right.
SPEAKER_00: I've been there before for...
SPEAKER_00: When you were a kid.
SPEAKER_00: And also another video.
SPEAKER_01: Oh.
SPEAKER_01: That same exact place or just...
SPEAKER_01: It was a different one.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: But then we went to white water rafting.
SPEAKER_00: Oh.
SPEAKER_00: And it was me, him, Toby and JJ.
SPEAKER_00: They shouldn't...
SPEAKER_01: Actually, you know what?
SPEAKER_01: They shouldn't have done it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I'm very mixed.
SPEAKER_01: I was just about to say they should have done it,
SPEAKER_01: but then I actually realized how mad those rapids were.
SPEAKER_00: Who's they?
SPEAKER_00: JJ and Toby didn't do it.
SPEAKER_00: Right.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So me and Vic went in.
SPEAKER_00: It was me and Vic in front of us,
SPEAKER_00: two instructors who, you know,
SPEAKER_00: literally do every day.
SPEAKER_00: Instructor.
SPEAKER_00: Behind us, the like,
SPEAKER_00: the main instructor who kind of controls it all.
SPEAKER_00: It was meant to be him, me, Vic, JJ, Toby.
SPEAKER_01: That would have been...
SPEAKER_01: That would have been so funny.
SPEAKER_00: It literally...
SPEAKER_00: It didn't end well.
SPEAKER_00: We went down it once,
SPEAKER_00: went around the whole thing.
SPEAKER_00: You have to start off.
SPEAKER_00: You have to jump into the water.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: And then kind of just slide down.
SPEAKER_01: See how, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Feel what it feels like to be in the water.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And then we went down at the second time
SPEAKER_00: and we kind of turn around on the rapids
SPEAKER_00: and try and like...
SPEAKER_01: Balance, basically.
SPEAKER_01: Balance in the swell.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I didn't really get it.
SPEAKER_01: So that, I think what that is is like,
SPEAKER_01: I think, I know expert,
SPEAKER_01: but I think in water rafting,
SPEAKER_01: it's important to be able to like
SPEAKER_01: control where you are
SPEAKER_01: and if you need to be able to kind of
SPEAKER_01: hold your position on the rapids.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know why.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe that's like a log.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: It's fallen in front of you.
SPEAKER_01: Actually, I'm making...
SPEAKER_02: I'm
SPEAKER_01: completely...
SPEAKER_01: It sounds good.
SPEAKER_01: It sounds really good.
SPEAKER_01: It seems like there is a reason
SPEAKER_01: to be able to try and hold yourself
SPEAKER_01: and start your point.
SPEAKER_01: So we're trying to teach us to do that.
SPEAKER_00: So it was...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So we turn around
SPEAKER_00: and then we go into the rapids
SPEAKER_00: and the guy's like,
SPEAKER_00: lean left.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, if you have to lean left.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Really right.
SPEAKER_00: Keep doing that.
SPEAKER_00: And eventually we started tipping a lot.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And then they basically,
SPEAKER_00: the whole thing just flipped.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And we ended up...
SPEAKER_00: I ended up under the raft.
SPEAKER_00: I didn't see what happened to you.
SPEAKER_00: I didn't hit
SPEAKER_01: myself in the chin
SPEAKER_01: with my awe.
SPEAKER_00: He told you to hold on.
SPEAKER_00: But
SPEAKER_01: when
Unknown: you're flipping.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And then, yeah,
SPEAKER_00: we just got sent down and...
SPEAKER_00: It was fun though.
SPEAKER_00: I actually really enjoyed it.
SPEAKER_00: I did really
SPEAKER_01: enjoy it.
SPEAKER_01: Because the fact that you went in
SPEAKER_02: on your own first to feel it out,
SPEAKER_02: like when you fall in,
SPEAKER_02: it's like same as that, right?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It was...
SPEAKER_02: Without the canoe on your head
SPEAKER_02: or whatever you're on.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It's a great way to play it
SPEAKER_02: while we're off.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Doing that in an actual, like,
SPEAKER_01: plastic canoe,
SPEAKER_01: I think I would die.
SPEAKER_01: I would just get stuck upside down.
SPEAKER_01: After the round.
SPEAKER_00: I actually have done that.
SPEAKER_00: Really?
SPEAKER_00: White water off the canoe.
SPEAKER_00: White water in the...
SPEAKER_00: In a canoe, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: In a solo canoe.
SPEAKER_02: We had two of us.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: It was PGL.
SPEAKER_02: I was in, like, year six.
SPEAKER_00: Are they quite...
SPEAKER_00: Were they quite big rapids?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: They have decent
SPEAKER_01: size.
SPEAKER_01: They're sick.
Unknown: It
SPEAKER_01: doesn't sound safe.
SPEAKER_01: But then again,
SPEAKER_01: when we were kids,
SPEAKER_01: health and safety...
SPEAKER_01: True.
SPEAKER_01: True, true.
SPEAKER_01: It's like PGL,
SPEAKER_02: which I'm pretty sure
SPEAKER_02: is stuff like parents get lost, right?
SPEAKER_02: I don't know what
SPEAKER_01: PGL is.
SPEAKER_01: Oh.
SPEAKER_01: It's like a school trip
SPEAKER_01: when I was sick, though.
SPEAKER_02: So good, man.
SPEAKER_02: Is it a time in the age where, like,
SPEAKER_02: you know when you do something
SPEAKER_02: pairs at school
SPEAKER_02: and you're picking partners?
SPEAKER_02: And then we had this friend
SPEAKER_02: and I was like,
SPEAKER_02: Rahm, I'll be with you, right?
SPEAKER_02: Dynamic duo.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And then someone else asked him,
SPEAKER_02: can I be in your team?
SPEAKER_02: I'm with Andrew.
SPEAKER_02: I'm with Big Randy.
SPEAKER_02: You're going to get a fuckmail
SPEAKER_02: or shit.
SPEAKER_02: I'm with a loser kid, man.
SPEAKER_01: Like Squid Game,
SPEAKER_01: where they just die.
SPEAKER_01: I'm sorry.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But so Toby and JD
SPEAKER_02: just didn't want to do it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, it is very scary.
SPEAKER_02: It looks very, it's very frightening.
SPEAKER_02: It's not just swimming,
SPEAKER_00: you know.
SPEAKER_00: Well, when we jumped in
SPEAKER_00: and then when we went down
SPEAKER_00: the first time
SPEAKER_00: and it was very calm,
SPEAKER_00: I was thinking,
SPEAKER_00: you know,
SPEAKER_00: like you should have done this.
SPEAKER_01: I think it was very calm, though,
SPEAKER_01: because we had three
SPEAKER_01: professional white water rappers
SPEAKER_01: with us.
SPEAKER_01: But
SPEAKER_00: I think the guy behind us
SPEAKER_00: could have done it on his own.
SPEAKER_00: Bro, Donny was like,
SPEAKER_00: yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Or is up
SPEAKER_00: and then he's just doing it himself.
SPEAKER_00: True.
SPEAKER_00: And I think
SPEAKER_00: we would have struggled a bit, but...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, true.
SPEAKER_01: He would have always kept it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: But I think the last one,
SPEAKER_00: 100%,
SPEAKER_00: they would have had a terrible time.
SPEAKER_01: They would have actually
SPEAKER_01: thought they were going to die.
SPEAKER_00: Good content.
SPEAKER_00: Like, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: True.
SPEAKER_00: JD would
SPEAKER_02: have had good content then.
SPEAKER_02: But you also,
SPEAKER_02: have you got your face painted?
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_00: did, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: That was...
SPEAKER_02: Also, he turned up
SPEAKER_02: when the podcast last week
SPEAKER_02: with Nathan Dore.
SPEAKER_02: My guy turns up with like
SPEAKER_02: eyeliner on.
SPEAKER_02: Do you look like Young Mentor?
SPEAKER_02: Bro,
SPEAKER_00: ever since that.
SPEAKER_00: So as soon as I had the eyeliner on,
SPEAKER_00: it was afterwards.
SPEAKER_00: I've washed it all off
SPEAKER_00: and I can't get rid of this bit.
SPEAKER_00: And then we had the Sidemen party
SPEAKER_00: and I still couldn't get rid of it.
SPEAKER_00: So I turned up
SPEAKER_00: and I've got this bit.
SPEAKER_00: With the smokey eye.
SPEAKER_00: But suddenly he was just like,
SPEAKER_00: oh, I just thought you were tired.
SPEAKER_00: Bro, try to rock.
SPEAKER_02: It was here.
SPEAKER_02: Not here.
SPEAKER_02: It
SPEAKER_00: wasn't like a bag.
SPEAKER_00: It was a line.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: It wasn't a bag.
SPEAKER_00: It was a line.
SPEAKER_00: Shit, bro.
SPEAKER_00: That was out of proportion.
SPEAKER_01: Sidemen party was crazy.
SPEAKER_02: So
SPEAKER_00: that point actually was crazy.
Unknown: It
SPEAKER_00: was.
SPEAKER_00: It was all right.
SPEAKER_00: I thought it was all right.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I compared it to last year
SPEAKER_00: and I really liked last year.
SPEAKER_00: This one.
SPEAKER_01: We were pretty hands on last year.
SPEAKER_01: I remember like,
SPEAKER_01: I went even to check out the venue
SPEAKER_01: before taking some keyboards
SPEAKER_01: out of the tree.
SPEAKER_01: Oh my God.
SPEAKER_01: That was so bad.
SPEAKER_01: They were like,
SPEAKER_01: gamer party,
SPEAKER_01: let's hang keyboards in my side of the tree.
SPEAKER_01: I got and I was like,
SPEAKER_01: take all of that out.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I didn't really want to do one.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: This was more of like,
SPEAKER_00: it's all being done.
SPEAKER_01: I think eight was also cool
SPEAKER_01: because we were launching Sides and XIX.
SPEAKER_01: Whereas this year,
SPEAKER_01: the charity match was our big thing of the year.

SPEAKER_01: There were so many people.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: He's getting bigger like that, isn't it?
SPEAKER_02: I actually feel
SPEAKER_00: bad for him, you know.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Because I was doing the classic walk around,
SPEAKER_00: say hi to everyone.
SPEAKER_00: And everyone, you know,
SPEAKER_00: wants to say hi to all the Sidemen kind of thing.

SPEAKER_00: He's like,
SPEAKER_00: I feel like he was there.
SPEAKER_00: He turned up a,
SPEAKER_00: I feel like he was there for
SPEAKER_01: a bit.
SPEAKER_01: I think he was there at least two out.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: At least two out.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I

SPEAKER_01: If you have enough,
SPEAKER_02: you
SPEAKER_01: can take all the selfies in the world.
SPEAKER_02: True.
SPEAKER_02: I had a shot.
SPEAKER_02: Who was it?
SPEAKER_02: It was like chip fat and a bunch of them
SPEAKER_02: coming to do a shot, right?
SPEAKER_02: Of the XX vodka.
SPEAKER_02: But they did it in like a regular cup
SPEAKER_02: rather than a shot glass.
SPEAKER_02: And they poured.
SPEAKER_02: It was like this much.
SPEAKER_02: They poured it themselves.
SPEAKER_02: No, no.
SPEAKER_02: They poured it for us.
SPEAKER_02: It was like this
SPEAKER_01: much.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: You did it just before I did.
SPEAKER_00: Because I went over to the bar
SPEAKER_00: and they all said,
SPEAKER_00: like, oh, we're doing a shot.
SPEAKER_00: I did that one with you.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And that was so easy.
SPEAKER_00: I went, oh, yeah,
SPEAKER_00: we're all doing a shot.
SPEAKER_00: And you were like, oh, don't do it.
SPEAKER_00: It was like this.
SPEAKER_00: And then they poured a shot.
SPEAKER_00: And it was, it was a shot.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Like it was a tiny shot.
SPEAKER_02: It's fucking killed us, man.
SPEAKER_02: I know one of the chip fat was out of it.
SPEAKER_02: I think
SPEAKER_00: it's because it was a triple what you did.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, I heard chip fat was only a triple.
SPEAKER_00: There was a
SPEAKER_01: meme with chip fat where it's like,
SPEAKER_01: if you go and do a shot with chip fat,
SPEAKER_01: it has to be a triple.
SPEAKER_01: That's only allowed to do triple shots.
SPEAKER_01: Because he wants to do more than 20 shots,
SPEAKER_01: which is what he did at the last year.
SPEAKER_01: He did that last year.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: If you end up like throwing up on the floor.
SPEAKER_01: Why would you want to do more?
SPEAKER_00: True.
SPEAKER_00: That's what working for the Sidemen does to you.
SPEAKER_00: Every year it's like, I need to drink more.
SPEAKER_00: And then
SPEAKER_02: Vodka for me is like doing too much.
SPEAKER_02: Just like, oh man.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I'm a cultured man now in Rome.
Unknown: You've
SPEAKER_01: always been a cultured man.
SPEAKER_01: Randy in the club with a cigar and a whiskey.
SPEAKER_01: True,
SPEAKER_02: true.
SPEAKER_01: Very cultured man.
SPEAKER_02: But I actually like, I had that shot.
SPEAKER_02: I guess now it's a triple.
SPEAKER_02: Now it makes sense.
SPEAKER_02: That adds up with why it was so much.
SPEAKER_02: We've broken it down.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Bro, I actually had to go to the toilet.
SPEAKER_02: I was like, I'm going to throw up.
SPEAKER_02: But I got there.
SPEAKER_02: It was really busy.
SPEAKER_02: I was like, okay.
SPEAKER_02: Never mind.
SPEAKER_00: If it wasn't busy, you would have just thrown up.
SPEAKER_00: Probably actually
SPEAKER_02: would have.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But I got there.
SPEAKER_02: I was like, okay.
SPEAKER_02: I just wash my hands and leave.
SPEAKER_00: All right.
Unknown: But
SPEAKER_02: it is fun to see everyone.
SPEAKER_02: I loved that chilli drink, man.
SPEAKER_02: The Picanto.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I had that before.
SPEAKER_02: Cultured man.
SPEAKER_02: That was really nice.

SPEAKER_01: and we had loads of them on tap there.
SPEAKER_01: And I was sinking them.
SPEAKER_02: Really?
SPEAKER_02: I had one then I skipped to the Picanto.
SPEAKER_02: The
SPEAKER_01: thing is I was on my,
SPEAKER_01: I think I was on my sixth.
SPEAKER_01: Man.
SPEAKER_01: I've forgotten who I was talking to.
SPEAKER_01: And they're like,
SPEAKER_01: Oh, I tried one of those Negronis.
SPEAKER_01: They're really, really strong.
SPEAKER_01: And I'm like,
Unknown: Oh,
SPEAKER_00: no.
SPEAKER_01: Am I wasted?
SPEAKER_01: Am I wasted?
SPEAKER_01: Am I going to be wasted?
SPEAKER_01: I mean, the
SPEAKER_00: fact you said,
SPEAKER_00: I can't remember who I was talking to.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I mean,
SPEAKER_00: It was in my bit of it.
SPEAKER_02: I left quite early because we did
SPEAKER_02: pitch side before and we've got

SPEAKER_02: It's a spirit.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Or he just said the mixers on the table

SPEAKER_02: actually, I was feeling,
SPEAKER_02: I've actually,

SPEAKER_02: That's his job.
SPEAKER_02: That's his job.
SPEAKER_02: He
SPEAKER_01: didn't want to take away his whole job.
SPEAKER_02: I made his day asking for a hot chocolate.
SPEAKER_02: But I should ask for that, though.
SPEAKER_00: When I had the,

SPEAKER_02: than just that one song before, you know.
SPEAKER_02: I was wondering what the parties
SPEAKER_02: were all saying the same shit.
SPEAKER_02: I want to kill my granddad.
SPEAKER_02: I don't tune God,
SPEAKER_02: I want to kill my mom.
SPEAKER_02: True.
SPEAKER_02: JJ is going to flip
SPEAKER_02: because JJ was mad at the songs recently, right?
SPEAKER_02: Oh yeah.
SPEAKER_02: JJ is
SPEAKER_00: very angry.
SPEAKER_00: He put in the chat about how
SPEAKER_00: music now he was like,
SPEAKER_00: oh, look at the top two songs.
SPEAKER_00: It's Lil Uzi Vert's new song
SPEAKER_00: and Poland by Lil Yachty.
SPEAKER_00: It's like neither of them are even songs.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: They're only a minute long.
SPEAKER_02: He said that,
SPEAKER_02: he said himself at Amabouma.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: He was like, he wasn't saying in the world of change.
SPEAKER_02: He was saying, you know,
SPEAKER_02: I'm kind of getting old.
SPEAKER_02: But I don't know, man,
SPEAKER_02: but even that Poland song,
SPEAKER_02: it just went viral.
SPEAKER_02: I don't think it was supposed to be on like Spotify.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's a banger.
SPEAKER_02: It's pretty good.
SPEAKER_02: I didn't think
SPEAKER_00: it's a banger.
SPEAKER_02: The Fortnite remix.
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: He's like,
SPEAKER_02: I took the slope to Tilted.
SPEAKER_00: So
SPEAKER_01: bad.
SPEAKER_01: Nah, bro.
SPEAKER_01: I thought that was going to be at least word play.
SPEAKER_01: Nah, man.
SPEAKER_01: It wasn't even close.
SPEAKER_01: Bang.
SPEAKER_02: How does it bang?
SPEAKER_02: It sounds really good.
SPEAKER_02: Does it just sound like the song with different words?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But the guy did it really well.
SPEAKER_02: It's really chill.
SPEAKER_02: Actually, it's a vibe.
SPEAKER_02: I hear it now.
SPEAKER_02: Can we get it?
SPEAKER_02: I mean, I would play it,
SPEAKER_02: but like my TikTok's just full of like,
SPEAKER_02: you know, memes already.
SPEAKER_02: You know what?
SPEAKER_02: TikTok's actually got a really good search these days.
SPEAKER_02: It's got far better than it used to
SPEAKER_00: be.
SPEAKER_02: Hold on.
SPEAKER_02: I can't accept this man.
Unknown: Are you
SPEAKER_00: finding it?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I'm going to find it.
SPEAKER_02: Here you go.
SPEAKER_02: Got it.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Bro.
SPEAKER_01: It's the tone change.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: He
SPEAKER_02: actually like,
SPEAKER_02: it's a vibe,
SPEAKER_00: man.
SPEAKER_01: 2022, man.
SPEAKER_01: Bro, I've
SPEAKER_02: been playing no build on Fortnite.
SPEAKER_02: It's fucking sick.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It's just fun.
Unknown: Have
SPEAKER_01: you played Overwatch 2?
SPEAKER_01: I haven't played it yet.
SPEAKER_02: I've been
SPEAKER_00: playing non-stop.
SPEAKER_00: It's good.
SPEAKER_00: I've been playing so much.
SPEAKER_00: You've been playing competitive.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: What rank?
SPEAKER_00: Well, I'm...
SPEAKER_00: Tin.
SPEAKER_00: I'm up.
SPEAKER_00: I'll have to go on five on damage.
SPEAKER_00: But yeah, that's not very good.
SPEAKER_00: Do you have a
SPEAKER_01: different rank for every class this time?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And
SPEAKER_00: you can also do open queue.
SPEAKER_00: And then that's a different rank.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I might have to get involved.
SPEAKER_00: JJ bangs it out.
SPEAKER_00: Really?
SPEAKER_00: Bangs out.
SPEAKER_00: He's playing a good rank.
SPEAKER_00: He's plat on...
SPEAKER_00: Damage, I think.
SPEAKER_00: But he plays console.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: He plays console
SPEAKER_00: for himself.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: He came to play on a PC one time.
SPEAKER_00: And he was just like, yeah, the same for me.
SPEAKER_00: It's different.
SPEAKER_00: It's different.
SPEAKER_02: Game is different.
SPEAKER_02: When you say PC, like, you're still with controller.
SPEAKER_02: He's still playing controller.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But
SPEAKER_00: anytime he goes up against, you know, like a...
SPEAKER_00: Like a Hanzo that is like a sniper kind of character,
SPEAKER_00: they just fuck him up.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: What's it like these days?
SPEAKER_01: Is it still like balance between keyboard and mouse and controller
SPEAKER_01: or is there one that's dominant?
SPEAKER_01: I mean keyboard and mouse is...
SPEAKER_01: Is better.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I love that.
SPEAKER_01: No, that's what I want.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, the
SPEAKER_00: game is still...
SPEAKER_00: I say I love the game.
SPEAKER_00: It's Overwatch one again.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: There's just three new characters.
SPEAKER_00: We won that hero in a few new heroes.
SPEAKER_00: And there's like a new map and that's it.
SPEAKER_00: And it's like, I'm just kind of using it until Cod comes out.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Which...
SPEAKER_01: It was really funny.
SPEAKER_01: We were sat...
SPEAKER_01: We went to like a gaming bar in Melbourne,
SPEAKER_01: which is actually quite sick, which is weird.
SPEAKER_01: It was like a gaming bar with a vibe,
SPEAKER_01: which I would never expect.
SPEAKER_01: It kind of helped that they were having packs
SPEAKER_01: at the same time there.
SPEAKER_01: So like they were gamers in town.
SPEAKER_01: But they had a stream up and it was Overwatch.
SPEAKER_01: And me and Rob were sat there and we were like,
SPEAKER_01: it's Overwatch one or two.
SPEAKER_01: We genuinely cannot tell.
SPEAKER_00: It is genuinely the same game.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Such a shame.
SPEAKER_02: I didn't know how to play, but I was playing once on stream.
SPEAKER_02: I was like a 24 hour stream, right?
SPEAKER_02: And I was Winston.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And I didn't know to like 10 minutes into the game
SPEAKER_02: that his gun only works close range, right?
SPEAKER_00: It's just out here trying to snipe
SPEAKER_02: people.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I was just like from a distance,
SPEAKER_02: I try to shoot people.
SPEAKER_02: And I was in the chat.
SPEAKER_02: And you were confused why you weren't getting any.
SPEAKER_02: But I didn't even know I was not getting anyone.
SPEAKER_02: I didn't know how the game works.
SPEAKER_02: So I was just in my own little world.
SPEAKER_02: I'm like, damn, it's pretty fun, man.
SPEAKER_02: It was like, you're doing nothing.
SPEAKER_02: Brandy just stood in for spawn.
SPEAKER_02: Winston.
SPEAKER_02: Oh my God.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: The games always felt confusing to me.
SPEAKER_02: Like
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_02: don't get it at all.
SPEAKER_01: I get why you don't get it.
SPEAKER_01: I'm sure I will.
SPEAKER_01: Like I've
SPEAKER_02: tried.
SPEAKER_01: It's one of those games you've got to understand
SPEAKER_01: all the abilities before you understand the game.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: We're Valorant.
SPEAKER_02: Like it's very self explanatory.
SPEAKER_02: Oh no, I'm the
SPEAKER_01: same.
SPEAKER_01: I watch Valorant and I don't know what's going on.
SPEAKER_01: Really?
SPEAKER_01: There's like things flying around walls,
SPEAKER_01: like different
SPEAKER_00: goo areas.
SPEAKER_00: So it's just knowledge then.
SPEAKER_00: The only thing about Valorant is it's much slower
Unknown: in
SPEAKER_00: terms of like you,
SPEAKER_00: because obviously it's like one life,
SPEAKER_00: you literally kind of go in
SPEAKER_00: and then you have one battle when you're out.
SPEAKER_00: Whereas Overwatch, you're literally like,
SPEAKER_00: you respawn, just run in.
SPEAKER_00: Run back, run back.
SPEAKER_00: But each hero has got a different
SPEAKER_02: gun though, right?
SPEAKER_02: On Overwatch or is it all the same?
SPEAKER_02: They've all got different guns.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_02: But I mean,
SPEAKER_00: you literally just press fire
SPEAKER_00: and you can pretty much tell what it is and stuff.
SPEAKER_00: Oh,
SPEAKER_02: I'll give it a go.
SPEAKER_02: I haven't played like 10 minutes, turned off.
SPEAKER_02: Stressed me out, man.
SPEAKER_02: Everyone in the chat was like,
SPEAKER_02: you don't even do anything like 10 minutes.
SPEAKER_02: You didn't do any damage.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I killed one guy finally, but...
SPEAKER_02: You think?
SPEAKER_02: I think, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Let's not cross the map with Winston.
SPEAKER_02: But the gaming world is dry though.
SPEAKER_02: I feel like there's no games, man.
SPEAKER_02: I feel bad for some streamers.
SPEAKER_02: Like what are they doing?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah,
SPEAKER_01: or even gaming YouTubers
SPEAKER_01: but it's gaming streamers.
SPEAKER_00: Or the cod.
SPEAKER_00: Cod.
SPEAKER_00: By the time this comes out,
SPEAKER_00: cod is out.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Multiplayer, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: You gonna get on it?
SPEAKER_01: Probably not multiplayer.
SPEAKER_01: I think I will actually probably need to though
SPEAKER_01: to get stuff for Warzone, right?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: That was the smartest thing they did
SPEAKER_02: for actual 2019 Warzone.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So many people bought.
SPEAKER_02: They did, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: You buy
SPEAKER_01: every cod to get guns.
SPEAKER_01: Because otherwise, what
SPEAKER_02: was it?
SPEAKER_02: Plumit?
SPEAKER_02: Was it
SPEAKER_01: plunder?
SPEAKER_02: Plunder.
SPEAKER_02: And that
SPEAKER_01: was sick though
SPEAKER_01: when you could do helicopter contract.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: You do the supply runs
SPEAKER_01: and you'd max a gun in like two hours.
SPEAKER_01: And then they packed that
SPEAKER_01: and I was like, no.
SPEAKER_01: No, you're like.
SPEAKER_01: No, I'm
SPEAKER_00: sad.
SPEAKER_00: I feel like I'm the only person
SPEAKER_00: that I've met
SPEAKER_00: that really has enjoyed cod multiplayer
SPEAKER_00: for the last three years.
SPEAKER_00: Because
SPEAKER_01: you didn't play like the originals.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you didn't rinse the originals.
SPEAKER_01: Like I put like probably 70 days
SPEAKER_01: into like cod 4, World at War,
SPEAKER_01: Modern Warfare 2, Black Ops 1,
SPEAKER_01: Black Ops 2.
SPEAKER_01: So I'm just...
SPEAKER_01: Black
SPEAKER_00: Ops 1 I did.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: But I think that was it.
SPEAKER_00: Modern Warfare 2 was the one
SPEAKER_00: that I got into.
SPEAKER_00: We should bring back
SPEAKER_01: more Sidemen,
SPEAKER_01: cod wager matches.
SPEAKER_01: I hope they have them
SPEAKER_01: in Modern Warfare 2.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think they will
SPEAKER_01: because it was more of a...
SPEAKER_01: Wager matches
SPEAKER_00: were the...
Unknown: They
SPEAKER_01: were in Black Ops.
SPEAKER_00: This is the one where you like...
SPEAKER_00: Sticks and stones.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: That was JJ's one in the chamber.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And I used to get
SPEAKER_01: to the last gun on a gun game
SPEAKER_01: and just knife everyone.
SPEAKER_01: Just put them back.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, set them back.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, that's like...
SPEAKER_00: That's one of my favorite videos from JJ.
SPEAKER_00: He's playing on one of the like ice maps
SPEAKER_00: and it's one in the chamber
SPEAKER_00: and he's like...
SPEAKER_00: Oh, one man.
SPEAKER_00: One gun.
SPEAKER_00: One bullet.
SPEAKER_00: Six men.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: He's like...
SPEAKER_00: And I remembered my chicken was ready.
SPEAKER_00: It's not going to happen.
SPEAKER_00: It's just top step.
SPEAKER_00: And then he just runs around and goes...
SPEAKER_00: Bang, bang, bang.
SPEAKER_00: And he goes...
SPEAKER_00: Then he ran at me like an angry baboon.
SPEAKER_00: And I said...
SPEAKER_00: Sit down, bitch.
SPEAKER_00: He's certainly just so funny, you know.
SPEAKER_00: It was.
SPEAKER_00: I
SPEAKER_02: remember...
SPEAKER_02: I might have thought this was the last podcast,
SPEAKER_02: but I don't know,
SPEAKER_02: so I'll just tell it again.
SPEAKER_02: But I was with...
SPEAKER_02: Castro on FIFA
SPEAKER_02: and we were talking about JJ.
SPEAKER_02: And he was like,
SPEAKER_02: Oh, you're good at FIFA though, right?
SPEAKER_02: I was like, no.
SPEAKER_02: They put me and Castro on like 1v1
SPEAKER_02: and the loser gets slimed.
SPEAKER_02: So obviously I got slimed
SPEAKER_02: because the guy plays it like a living.
SPEAKER_02: And then he's like,
SPEAKER_02: Oh, no, but you're still good at FIFA.
SPEAKER_02: You beat JJ, right?
SPEAKER_02: And I was like, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But JJ's shit at FIFA.
SPEAKER_02: Like he's really like not good at all.
SPEAKER_02: Like he's like,
SPEAKER_02: No, but he's like...
SPEAKER_02: He was a FIFA YouTuber.
SPEAKER_02: I'm like, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It wasn't about being good at FIFA.
SPEAKER_02: It wasn't about being extra.
SPEAKER_02: Well, back
SPEAKER_00: then as well,
SPEAKER_00: it was easy to be good at FIFA.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But now you just have used the, what's good.
SPEAKER_02: He would have done that.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, back in the day is better than me,
SPEAKER_02: but I mean,
SPEAKER_02: he still will beat me now.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not great, but it's not hard.
SPEAKER_02: Although he stopped playing.
SPEAKER_02: Has he?
SPEAKER_02: No, I watch.
SPEAKER_00: He was, he was bagging the game out
SPEAKER_00: and he was like, yeah, I'm into six.
SPEAKER_00: This is my new team.
SPEAKER_00: You know, he'd link cards in the chat
SPEAKER_00: and stuff like that.
SPEAKER_00: And I was like,
SPEAKER_00: What the fuck is going
SPEAKER_02: on?
SPEAKER_02: Is the new FIFA out?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: It came out at the end of September.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: They recorded clubs the other day.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I mean,
SPEAKER_00: Oh, you weren't there.
SPEAKER_00: No, no, no.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it was.
SPEAKER_01: Harry said he didn't enjoy it, which is
SPEAKER_01: apparently Harry doesn't
SPEAKER_00: like clubs.
SPEAKER_01: Oh,
SPEAKER_00: because whenever we've recorded,
SPEAKER_00: it's like,
SPEAKER_00: you don't enjoy clubs much.
SPEAKER_00: Like it's fun,
SPEAKER_00: but it's okay.
SPEAKER_00: It's not your.
SPEAKER_00: Well,
SPEAKER_01: actually,
SPEAKER_01: I don't enjoy as much as it just doesn't.
SPEAKER_01: It's,
SPEAKER_01: I think the videos are good,
SPEAKER_01: but they just don't do well.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And that's what,
SPEAKER_01: that's what it,
SPEAKER_01: because it takes probably more time
SPEAKER_01: to record that than something.
SPEAKER_01: 100%.
SPEAKER_01: And then when it doesn't do as well,
SPEAKER_01: I'm like,
SPEAKER_01: okay.
SPEAKER_00: It's because it was,
SPEAKER_00: I feel like it was like an iconic
SPEAKER_00: more Sidemen series.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And then it just fell off.
SPEAKER_00: It was an
SPEAKER_01: iconic Sidemen channel series.
SPEAKER_01: It was the first series
SPEAKER_01: we started on the Sidemen channel.
SPEAKER_00: And then it just, yeah,
SPEAKER_00: it fell off like among us is now
SPEAKER_00: like a classic Sidemen series.
SPEAKER_00: But yeah,
SPEAKER_00: then Harry apparently doesn't enjoy clubs.
SPEAKER_00: I
Unknown: heard
SPEAKER_02: it
SPEAKER_00: through the grapevine.
SPEAKER_00: Wow.
SPEAKER_00: I was confused.
SPEAKER_02: There you go.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Simon fans are crying.
Unknown: How could he?
SPEAKER_00: Well, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I don't think clubs
SPEAKER_00: is coming back anytime soon now.
SPEAKER_00: I'm
SPEAKER_01: not complaining.
SPEAKER_01: I feel like,
SPEAKER_01: I feel like there's so much we can do
SPEAKER_01: with that channel.
SPEAKER_00: 100%.
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_01: think
SPEAKER_00: it's actually,
SPEAKER_00: it hurts me knowing that obviously
SPEAKER_00: you posted so many videos
SPEAKER_00: over the year,
SPEAKER_00: like over so many years.
SPEAKER_00: So have I.
SPEAKER_00: So has Josh.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So has Ethan.
SPEAKER_00: And we can't get more Sidemen posting.
SPEAKER_00: Like we struggle with
SPEAKER_00: two or three weeks.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: We would do recordings,
SPEAKER_01: but it was our whole life.
SPEAKER_01: It was.
SPEAKER_01: We would wake up to record
SPEAKER_01: for four hours to edit the video,
SPEAKER_01: to post them,
SPEAKER_01: to do it again the next day.
SPEAKER_01: Even
SPEAKER_00: still,
SPEAKER_00: we would record for,
SPEAKER_00: yeah, four hours.
SPEAKER_00: Now,
SPEAKER_00: we record for like two hours
SPEAKER_00: and people's attention spans have gone.
SPEAKER_01: It was so much easier back then as well
SPEAKER_01: because we just had to record the content
SPEAKER_01: and make the content good.
SPEAKER_01: And I was posting
SPEAKER_01: GTA episode 432.
SPEAKER_01: Now you need the title.
SPEAKER_01: Now you need the title and the thumbnail
SPEAKER_01: or no one's going to click it.
SPEAKER_01: So it was a different time.
SPEAKER_01: We were able to do that.
SPEAKER_01: We could record so much volume,
SPEAKER_01: but it doesn't,
SPEAKER_01: it's not about recording volume
SPEAKER_01: on YouTube at the moment.
Unknown: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: But still, I think like,
SPEAKER_00: I think we like,
SPEAKER_00: some of us have gone through the phase of
SPEAKER_00: just grinding for 12 hours a day.
SPEAKER_00: We could sit there
SPEAKER_00: and if we had the ideas there.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Would you happily like,
SPEAKER_00: would you happily sit there?
SPEAKER_00: You go one day.
SPEAKER_00: I'd spend six hours
SPEAKER_01: recording gaming
SPEAKER_01: for more Sidemen.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So long as everything works,
SPEAKER_01: so long
SPEAKER_00: as it's that way.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And if you enjoy the games as well,
SPEAKER_02: it goes by really quick.
SPEAKER_02: If you enjoy the game,
SPEAKER_02: it's like just drags.
SPEAKER_02: And also
SPEAKER_00: if, yeah,
SPEAKER_00: if something doesn't work
SPEAKER_00: like the Among Us mod.
SPEAKER_00: The second that happened
SPEAKER_00: and we spent two hours.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: That's sick thumbnails.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But then when thumbnails didn't matter.
SPEAKER_01: Short and sweet clips.
SPEAKER_01: Short and sweet clips, bro.
SPEAKER_01: Do
SPEAKER_00: you think, right,
SPEAKER_00: if say you were doing these videos
SPEAKER_00: 11 years ago.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: And you had today's thumbnails.
SPEAKER_00: Do you think people would,
SPEAKER_00: like they would do way better?
Unknown: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I'm just,
SPEAKER_01: I don't know what's happening.
SPEAKER_01: It's all right.
SPEAKER_00: Rain in care packages.
SPEAKER_00: I think we
SPEAKER_01: crashed.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think we crashed them.
SPEAKER_01: Oh my God.
SPEAKER_01: I love this fucking game.
SPEAKER_01: We crashed
Unknown: the
SPEAKER_01: games.
SPEAKER_01: Graphics.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know why.
SPEAKER_00: Oh my God.
SPEAKER_01: Oh my God.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: That's sick.
Unknown: That
SPEAKER_02: is sick.
SPEAKER_02: Bro, you know what?
SPEAKER_02: You know,
SPEAKER_02: look at this description.
SPEAKER_02: Look at the description.
SPEAKER_02: We like that and everything.
Unknown: And
SPEAKER_02: also you would have increased in
SPEAKER_02: however old you were.
SPEAKER_02: No, no.
SPEAKER_02: I can picture your fucking voices
SPEAKER_02: or your little squeaky voices.
SPEAKER_02: Oh my God.
SPEAKER_00: See, I miss content like that.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Like the little short.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Imagine
SPEAKER_01: you drop that on your channel today.
SPEAKER_01: 30 seconds of care packages falling.
SPEAKER_01: What the fuck is this?
SPEAKER_01: But I guess that's.
SPEAKER_00: That could be a short.
SPEAKER_00: It could be a TikTok.
SPEAKER_00: It could be a TikTok.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe content is
SPEAKER_02: going backwards.
SPEAKER_02: Just for the best editors.
Unknown: Well,
SPEAKER_00: back then as well,
SPEAKER_00: if you posted that was before I even started,
SPEAKER_00: but I remember you guys always saying
SPEAKER_00: if you posted a video like two a day back then,
SPEAKER_00: everyone called you like a money whore.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Whereas now if you don't post every five days,
SPEAKER_00: everyone's like, well, this guy's lazy.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: If someone else edited your video,
SPEAKER_01: it was like, wow.
SPEAKER_01: I remember that.
SPEAKER_01: If you edit your own videos,
SPEAKER_01: you're such a wow loser.
SPEAKER_01: You don't even care.
SPEAKER_01: You don't even care about your channel.
Unknown: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Makes no sense.
SPEAKER_01: I'm paying someone to make this better.
SPEAKER_01: Wow.
SPEAKER_01: You're so out of touch.
SPEAKER_01: You don't even care.
SPEAKER_02: Oh my God.
SPEAKER_02: YouTube was,
SPEAKER_02: it's gone through a really crazy cycle actually,
SPEAKER_02: but it's obviously,
SPEAKER_02: we're glad.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It could have been a shit.
SPEAKER_02: It's turned out all right.
SPEAKER_02: It's turned out all right.
SPEAKER_00: That first video going up that an editor's done was like.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: You'd like it.
SPEAKER_00: Terrifying.
SPEAKER_00: I hope no one notices.
SPEAKER_00: Oh my God.
SPEAKER_00: If someone points out this thing or this thing.
SPEAKER_02: Jump cut.
SPEAKER_02: Fucking hell.
SPEAKER_02: Simon, that's not you.

SPEAKER_01: everyone's bigging up the YouTube shorts at the moment.
SPEAKER_02: More apparently looking to monetize it.
SPEAKER_02: So.
SPEAKER_00: Properly.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Well, it is clear that happens
SPEAKER_02: and.
SPEAKER_02: TikTok has like shifted content a lot.
SPEAKER_02: So they're probably looking at that and trying to compete.
SPEAKER_02: But it looks like they don't have to anymore
SPEAKER_02: because they aren't the US.
SPEAKER_02: Just going to ban it.
Unknown: Why
SPEAKER_02: didn't know about this?
SPEAKER_02: Is that, is that a thing?
SPEAKER_02: Well, JJ said it.
SPEAKER_02: So I believe it.
SPEAKER_02: JJ,
SPEAKER_01: our political leader.
SPEAKER_01: He doesn't
SPEAKER_00: read a lot though.
SPEAKER_00: I read nothing to do with the news.
SPEAKER_00: So I actually only know what JJ puts in the chat.
SPEAKER_00: He is
SPEAKER_02: a sucker for headlines.
SPEAKER_02: He is.
SPEAKER_01: And I think I'm one source.
SPEAKER_01: I feel like he'll always have one source.
SPEAKER_01: Oh yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And he'll just believe that.
SPEAKER_01: It's just a YouTube video.
SPEAKER_01: Or yeah, he's recommended.
SPEAKER_00: Video comes up and he's just like, yo.
SPEAKER_00: Do you know Liz Truss was an alien?
Unknown: Yeah,
SPEAKER_02: bro.
SPEAKER_02: It's funny though.
SPEAKER_02: He enjoys it.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But I think YouTube, oh, from my head,
SPEAKER_02: I really try to push the shorts, but...
SPEAKER_02: Will that get you back?
SPEAKER_02: What's that?
SPEAKER_02: Will that get you back?
SPEAKER_02: I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: Daily, daily,
SPEAKER_01: daily, daily.
SPEAKER_01: You could just do daily shorts for all the content.
SPEAKER_01: My favorite shorts were Harry's.
SPEAKER_01: Harry's shorts.
SPEAKER_01: You're so good.
SPEAKER_01: We're incredible.
SPEAKER_01: Please, please don't get this man another deal for shorts.
SPEAKER_01: What is it?
SPEAKER_01: The egg
SPEAKER_02: one.
SPEAKER_02: Remember the egg one?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: He's like, you know, he goes like,
SPEAKER_02: bro, I never knew there was white eggs.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: He's like, I didn't know they could do white eggs.
SPEAKER_02: He
SPEAKER_00: cracks it.
SPEAKER_00: He just goes all over his
SPEAKER_02: cooker.
SPEAKER_02: It's short.
SPEAKER_02: It's really, obviously, but it's really short.
SPEAKER_01: I'd like to believe that this is stage
SPEAKER_01: and he thinks this is funny,
SPEAKER_01: but he has that.
SPEAKER_01: I'm sure he has done this.
SPEAKER_01: There's
SPEAKER_00: no way.
SPEAKER_01: What a guy.
SPEAKER_00: They're normal eggs.
SPEAKER_00: They're just white.
SPEAKER_00: That's
SPEAKER_02: it.
SPEAKER_02: No, no, no, watch,
Unknown: watch.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, dear.
SPEAKER_02: And people are wondering like, damn, like, like Harry's, you know.
SPEAKER_00: What does he do on a day to day?
SPEAKER_00: I bet it's like coming up with business ventures
SPEAKER_00: and video ideas.
SPEAKER_00: It's just that.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It's just funny how like a lot of content like that
SPEAKER_02: and big moments just happen.
SPEAKER_02: Like obviously I've,
SPEAKER_02: because I've been doing the sidecar,
SPEAKER_02: I just see all the screenshots from the videos.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.
SPEAKER_02: Like him hitting his mum, like it's just,
SPEAKER_02: it wasn't supposed to happen.
Unknown: You
SPEAKER_00: know,
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_00: think that's just the thing with like videos in general,
SPEAKER_00: though stuff just goes right a lot.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Water.
SPEAKER_00: But you have to
SPEAKER_01: do enough and you have to create
SPEAKER_01: the right parameters for stuff to go right.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And then sometimes, yeah,
SPEAKER_01: you have videos where like an example being
SPEAKER_01: the Mr. Beast video,
SPEAKER_01: that nothing remarkable happened in that video.
SPEAKER_01: True.
SPEAKER_01: Perhaps Nolan guessing like four doors in a row.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: That was pretty like, whoa.
SPEAKER_01: But beyond that,
SPEAKER_01: not a single remarkable thing happened in that video.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It could have,
SPEAKER_01: but it just didn't.
SPEAKER_01: And a lot of people will be like,
SPEAKER_01: oh, you know,
SPEAKER_01: something used to be so much funnier
SPEAKER_01: when something else happened.
SPEAKER_01: But it's just like,
SPEAKER_01: sometimes stuff just doesn't happen that way.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: If you rely on,
SPEAKER_00: if you rely on something that is like a one take thing,
SPEAKER_00: you just have to hope that it goes right.
SPEAKER_00: Like the total wipeout we did
SPEAKER_00: where Ethan almost broke his back.
SPEAKER_00: It's like,
SPEAKER_00: I know that went wrong,
SPEAKER_00: but it went right for content.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Now he's fine.
SPEAKER_00: It's like,
SPEAKER_02: There's all ball,
SPEAKER_02: like him getting hit with that.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Even the,
SPEAKER_02: the whole in a war video.
SPEAKER_02: I was just about to say that one.
SPEAKER_02: Like JJ just like went crazy and it worked.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Him doing water, man.
SPEAKER_01: It wasn't planned.
SPEAKER_00: He wasn't meant to even wear the thing.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: It was like a bandana here
SPEAKER_00: and he was just going to wear it normally
SPEAKER_00: and then Toby put it on his own face.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And then we were like,
SPEAKER_00: Oh, it'd be funny for JJ
SPEAKER_00: because his hair will stick out the top.
Unknown: And
SPEAKER_01: now he's on the top skirt.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And that
SPEAKER_00: character is like,
SPEAKER_00: one of the funniest ones he's ever done.
SPEAKER_00: I actually really
SPEAKER_02: want that card,
SPEAKER_02: by the way.
SPEAKER_02: I'm checking EV for that card.
SPEAKER_02: Scouring.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: They all got
SPEAKER_01: water, man.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: I'll buy it from you.
SPEAKER_02: It looks fucking sick.
SPEAKER_02: It's sick.
SPEAKER_02: Even because it's got like a pink background
SPEAKER_02: as well.
SPEAKER_02: It just looks really good.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So many things like that.
SPEAKER_01: Also in that video,
SPEAKER_01: one of my favorite moments of that whole video,
SPEAKER_01: it's when JJ had to line his back
SPEAKER_01: with his legs up in the air.
SPEAKER_01: And Andrew.
SPEAKER_01: That was the first one.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And the first one,
SPEAKER_01: and that was so easy to do.
SPEAKER_01: You just measure where your legs need to be.
SPEAKER_01: You stick them up.
SPEAKER_01: The wall would have gone past him.
SPEAKER_01: No one would have laughed.
SPEAKER_01: It would have been like,
SPEAKER_01: Oh, nice.
SPEAKER_01: Good job.
SPEAKER_01: Instead,
SPEAKER_01: he gets his legs too wide.
SPEAKER_01: He gets folded over backwards.
SPEAKER_01: It was so slow as well.
SPEAKER_01: And it's hysterical.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: That's content.
SPEAKER_01: You just have to create the parameters.
SPEAKER_01: I want to watch it again.
SPEAKER_01: It's so slow.
SPEAKER_01: I've actually watched the video
SPEAKER_01: like three times.
SPEAKER_02: It's crazy.
SPEAKER_01: He
SPEAKER_00: gets folded in.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, good watch that one.
SPEAKER_01: And then there's Ethan,
SPEAKER_02: holding his nose
SPEAKER_02: and then letting go
SPEAKER_02: when he actually goes in the water.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: When he does the bomb onto the platform.
SPEAKER_00: So good.
SPEAKER_00: I think it might be that spike.
SPEAKER_00: It's right at the end.
SPEAKER_00: It's very close to the end.
SPEAKER_00: What's that spike though?
SPEAKER_01: Oh, this was a disaster.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, this
SPEAKER_00: was, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: This was bad.
SPEAKER_00: It's just the wrong way.
SPEAKER_00: No, Toby jumps.
SPEAKER_00: I rate
SPEAKER_01: Toby for trying.
SPEAKER_00: But he jumps and ruins it.
SPEAKER_00: See, I see.
SPEAKER_01: JJ's head.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: That's what I thought.
SPEAKER_00: I got messed up with my back.
SPEAKER_00: And then you go to the end.
SPEAKER_00: I think it is.
SPEAKER_00: There's W.
SPEAKER_00: Just check the spikes.
SPEAKER_00: No, no.
SPEAKER_00: Is
Unknown: it
SPEAKER_01: the end?
SPEAKER_01: He's doing it there.
SPEAKER_01: The one before.
SPEAKER_01: That
SPEAKER_00: one.
Unknown: Yeah,
SPEAKER_00: because they both failed.
SPEAKER_00: So we're like, you have to go in.
Unknown: Is
SPEAKER_01: this where he tries to see it drop through
Unknown: the...
Unknown: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: He tries to jump onto the thing
SPEAKER_00: and he holds his nose.
SPEAKER_00: And then falls
SPEAKER_01: off.
SPEAKER_01: Holds his nose.
SPEAKER_00: Let's go.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that video did really well.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, it did really well.
SPEAKER_01: It was all right.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Fortunately, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Because that could have been one that was big budget
SPEAKER_01: and just didn't go anywhere.
SPEAKER_01: But
SPEAKER_00: we only found out on the day as well.
SPEAKER_00: Did you see how there's a big gap underneath it?
SPEAKER_00: It wasn't meant to be there at all.
SPEAKER_00: But they basically just did it and said
SPEAKER_00: there has to be a gap.
SPEAKER_00: Otherwise the thing will scrape and break.
SPEAKER_00: So it kind of messed us up a bit.
SPEAKER_00: It was way bigger than it should have been.
SPEAKER_00: It's a way
SPEAKER_01: to cut some bits off.
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_00: Between the bottom of
SPEAKER_01: the board and the floor.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_01: And it was actually really bad
SPEAKER_01: because the shapes were designed
SPEAKER_01: so that you would fit in them if you were at the bottom.
SPEAKER_01: So it was like just a slight mess up really.
SPEAKER_00: So it's like if I'm meant to stand like this,
SPEAKER_00: the head piece, because it's moved up
SPEAKER_00: because of that, is now here.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So I have to awkwardly try and jump.
SPEAKER_00: We always had to jump for all of it.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And if we were trying to do it seriously,
SPEAKER_01: we would have said this is not going to work.
SPEAKER_01: We can't compete in this game.
SPEAKER_01: No way.
SPEAKER_01: But instead we literally just got knocked in
SPEAKER_01: and just failed with everything.
SPEAKER_01: It was a better video.
SPEAKER_01: So you see where
SPEAKER_00: mine is, how it's my head.
SPEAKER_00: I'm meant to be, that's meant to be on the floor.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: But obviously it's like a yard above.
SPEAKER_01: That's mad.
SPEAKER_01: That one worked out better.
SPEAKER_01: He hit me
SPEAKER_00: square in the head.
Unknown: You
SPEAKER_02: were freezing in the video.
SPEAKER_00: Josh had a win.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Josh had W host.
SPEAKER_00: Well, to be fair though,
SPEAKER_00: he actually really wanted to do it.
SPEAKER_00: Hole in the wall is one that he was wanting.
SPEAKER_00: He was like, hole in the wall be sick
SPEAKER_00: like it's won the game show.
SPEAKER_00: He could have got
SPEAKER_01: a guest.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: He didn't want that wall.
SPEAKER_00: True.
SPEAKER_00: That
SPEAKER_01: was
SPEAKER_00: freezing.
SPEAKER_01: I see.
Unknown: Do
SPEAKER_00: you prefer the big shoots or like the smaller shoots?
SPEAKER_00: Because me and Josh realized the holiday videos,
SPEAKER_00: both of them, the two biggest videos,
SPEAKER_00: neither of them we had a cameraman.
Unknown: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Even the Europe one where we went to Benidorm.
SPEAKER_00: We had a security line.
SPEAKER_00: That was it.
SPEAKER_01: Mad.
SPEAKER_00: Jon's out of a job.
SPEAKER_01: Two questions there, I guess.
SPEAKER_01: I prefer the more loosely formatted videos.
SPEAKER_01: My favorite videos are like the traveling ones
SPEAKER_01: where you get to do stuff.
SPEAKER_01: You just go with the flow.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think it makes a difference
SPEAKER_01: whether we have camera people or cameras ourselves
SPEAKER_01: because I think we're now at the point where
SPEAKER_01: we'll miss things if we're having to vlog it ourselves
SPEAKER_01: because we just don't have that same mindset.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's good to have a combo of both
SPEAKER_01: but it's also really nice.
SPEAKER_01: There are some things like, for example,
SPEAKER_01: in the Europe calories video,
SPEAKER_01: me, Harry and Lana are literally sprinting
SPEAKER_01: to try and find out where this hot air balloon is landing.
SPEAKER_01: We would have struggled to vlog that kind of thing.
SPEAKER_01: So it's nice sometimes just knowing
SPEAKER_01: that you can do what you do
SPEAKER_01: and I feel like you actually get better content
SPEAKER_01: for having it shot for you.
Unknown: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: There we go.
SPEAKER_01: Jon celebrates.
SPEAKER_01: So, yeah, that's...
SPEAKER_01: I prefer having cameras
SPEAKER_01: and my favorites, yeah,
SPEAKER_01: they're going out there.
SPEAKER_01: I'm stressed by big studio videos
SPEAKER_01: because I've had two big ones
SPEAKER_01: that I've been partial organizer of.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, the missed beast.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And then the next week's video
SPEAKER_01: was a big one.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So
Unknown: maybe
SPEAKER_01: let's chill out for a bit.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I remember Ethan was really stressed as well
SPEAKER_02: for the escape rooms, right?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah,
SPEAKER_01: that was a tough one.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, because
SPEAKER_02: you couldn't see them, right?
SPEAKER_02: So he's like a combination of like...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
Unknown: He
SPEAKER_02: can organize them, but you can't actually see them
SPEAKER_02: because he's looking at the answer.
SPEAKER_01: At the same time, I feel like
SPEAKER_01: the easy solution to that is just be a host.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, 100%.
SPEAKER_01: Be a host.
SPEAKER_01: No, exactly what the things are
SPEAKER_01: and just put someone else into play,
SPEAKER_01: but I feel like it's easy to miss, obviously,
SPEAKER_01: apps when you're making videos.
SPEAKER_00: I think next week's video,
SPEAKER_00: the big shoot you were talking about,
SPEAKER_00: I think that's my favorite big shoot we've done
SPEAKER_00: in terms of video.
SPEAKER_01: Interesting.
SPEAKER_00: Like, I think the missed beast one was a lot of fun, but...
SPEAKER_01: It wasn't Psy.
SPEAKER_01: It was spectacle, but not Psy.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah,
SPEAKER_00: yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I left it thinking
SPEAKER_00: there wasn't much personality of us in there
SPEAKER_00: and whereas this one I left
SPEAKER_00: and I was like, yeah, this one was good.
SPEAKER_00: Like really, really good.
SPEAKER_00: It's very us.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think it's like the perfect combination of like
SPEAKER_00: us and production.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I agree.
SPEAKER_00: So, yeah, this week's video, banger.
SPEAKER_02: Sick.
SPEAKER_00: There we go.
SPEAKER_00: Or should be a nine out of 10.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, honestly, that's the way the game goes.
SPEAKER_01: It's literally the way,
SPEAKER_02: exactly the way it goes.
SPEAKER_02: But yeah, I think...
SPEAKER_02: Oh, what's this?
SPEAKER_02: Oh, culture.
SPEAKER_02: 92
SPEAKER_00: million.
SPEAKER_00: That's our most viewed video.
SPEAKER_00: That's crazy.
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_00: think that as well, that one is...
SPEAKER_00: That's the perfect video
SPEAKER_00: in terms of...
SPEAKER_00: We were on the bad team, but
SPEAKER_00: it was so fun.
SPEAKER_00: And the good team obviously just had like an amazing time.
Unknown: Because
SPEAKER_00: I know the first one where you were in London,
SPEAKER_00: as much as you meant to do the bad team...
SPEAKER_00: It actually really happened.
SPEAKER_00: You didn't actually do anything.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And I don't think you had that much fun
SPEAKER_00: that you were
Unknown: like...
Unknown: And
SPEAKER_01: the secret ingredient is alcohol.
SPEAKER_01: Every Sidemen video is better.
SPEAKER_01: It's true.
SPEAKER_01: There's alcohol involved.
SPEAKER_01: Which is the
SPEAKER_02: one...
SPEAKER_02: Neither of you were there, the cube.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, exactly.
SPEAKER_01: That was so
SPEAKER_02: bad.
SPEAKER_02: And then we just got pissed and it was so good.
SPEAKER_01: You know, I organised that whole video.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And because JJ didn't like the shoot,
SPEAKER_01: he had me take a yellow card
SPEAKER_01: and only get half the video.
SPEAKER_01: I enjoyed that video.
SPEAKER_02: I can't say anything else in there.
SPEAKER_02: I think it was because they were like...
SPEAKER_02: Ask Vic about the thumbnail.
SPEAKER_02: He hasn't replied.
Unknown: I had go for
SPEAKER_02: it.
Unknown: That
SPEAKER_01: was an incredible video.
SPEAKER_01: Too fair it didn't do very well though.
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: Too fair.
SPEAKER_01: I remember watching
SPEAKER_00: this video and thinking,
SPEAKER_00: no one wants to be.
SPEAKER_01: I laughed.
SPEAKER_01: I laughed more than like other videos.
SPEAKER_01: They were fine people.
SPEAKER_01: They even tried.
SPEAKER_01: Stephen tried.
SPEAKER_01: It's the secret sauce also.
Unknown: Well,
SPEAKER_00: now we know as well
SPEAKER_00: that we actually can miss
SPEAKER_00: like multiple people.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: We've done shoots now
SPEAKER_00: where three of us are missing.
Unknown: True,
SPEAKER_01: true, true.
SPEAKER_00: So I think as much as it does
SPEAKER_00: kind of take away from the Sidemen,
SPEAKER_00: it's more of like, okay,
SPEAKER_00: there's proof that there's longevity.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Because before we were like,
SPEAKER_00: okay, if one Sidemen's gone.
SPEAKER_00: It's done.
SPEAKER_00: The house of cards collapses.
SPEAKER_00: And obviously JJ was missing
SPEAKER_00: and Ethan was missing.
SPEAKER_00: You've been missing.
SPEAKER_00: We all had COVID.
SPEAKER_00: Missed some.
SPEAKER_00: So yeah.
SPEAKER_00: We can prove that we can survive.
SPEAKER_02: We'll survive.
SPEAKER_00: Nice.
SPEAKER_00: Was this you trying to step over it?
SPEAKER_00: Bro, you were so bad.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I was drunk and blind.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Look how replayed that.
SPEAKER_01: By the way.
Unknown: I
SPEAKER_02: was really disappointed.
SPEAKER_02: It's the last one when
SPEAKER_01: you jump, isn't it?
SPEAKER_02: They take them off.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: That's that one.
SPEAKER_01: No, no, no.
SPEAKER_01: It's the clip where they put it.
SPEAKER_01: They put it up.
SPEAKER_01: This clip here.
SPEAKER_01: This actually finished me.
SPEAKER_01: What is this?
Unknown: Did
SPEAKER_02: you know?
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: I felt like you could have heard them.
SPEAKER_02: Bro, I had no idea.
SPEAKER_02: I'm absolutely pissed.
SPEAKER_00: It's the fact, right?
SPEAKER_00: You've got nothing.
SPEAKER_00: And you somehow walked into the wall.
SPEAKER_02: That's where you can't write it
SPEAKER_02: and it just won't.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: After that first step as well,
SPEAKER_02: in my head I was really happy.
SPEAKER_02: I was like, wow, I've just smashed that.
SPEAKER_02: Right, you've got the phone.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah,
SPEAKER_00: yeah.
SPEAKER_00: That was so good.
SPEAKER_02: It was like a shambles of a shoot
SPEAKER_02: because everyone was just giddy.
SPEAKER_02: You know what I'm saying?
SPEAKER_02: That's good though, that's good.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it helped.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, there's four of the boys,
SPEAKER_02: me and then Stephen.
SPEAKER_02: I also said on the podcast
SPEAKER_02: when we filmed that one,
SPEAKER_02: I was really angry, right?
SPEAKER_02: Because whoever the camera people were,
SPEAKER_02: I know who they were,
SPEAKER_02: but I won't say.
SPEAKER_02: They had like wide angle lenses, right?
SPEAKER_02: Bare wide.
SPEAKER_02: And they would smush
SPEAKER_02: together all the time.
SPEAKER_02: So there's not many of us, right?
SPEAKER_02: And we're always like,
SPEAKER_02: me and Jason Toby,
SPEAKER_02: we're like,
SPEAKER_02: we're like,
SPEAKER_02: literally like sideways on
SPEAKER_02: and like together.
SPEAKER_02: And then all guys,
SPEAKER_02: can you squish in?
SPEAKER_02: And I'm like, how about you walk back?
SPEAKER_02: Like, please,
SPEAKER_02: like walk back,
Unknown: man.
SPEAKER_02: You'll fill us in.
SPEAKER_02: Cause we just pull it off
SPEAKER_02: and just go to any shop
SPEAKER_02: where we're all like,
SPEAKER_02: that's not bad.
SPEAKER_02: And we find us all together
SPEAKER_02: in stages.
SPEAKER_02: Where they're against
SPEAKER_00: the wall.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think it's earlier
SPEAKER_02: on.
SPEAKER_02: It's earlier on.
SPEAKER_02: One of the first ones.
SPEAKER_02: Randy's onto it.
Unknown: Look at
SPEAKER_01: Jason standing.
SPEAKER_01: Ethan.
SPEAKER_01: That is very uncomfortable.
SPEAKER_02: And there's more examples,
SPEAKER_02: but go a bit earlier on perhaps.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that one, that one, that one.
SPEAKER_02: John's coming.
SPEAKER_01: Not John.
SPEAKER_02: Randy's coming for your job.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Get Randy on the lens.
SPEAKER_02: It's always funny, man.
SPEAKER_02: It's
SPEAKER_00: so squished.
SPEAKER_02: I'm being overdramatic, of course,
SPEAKER_02: but like,
SPEAKER_02: they could have walked back.
SPEAKER_02: It's cute
SPEAKER_01: though, it's intimate.
SPEAKER_01: It was nice.
SPEAKER_01: It was nice.
SPEAKER_01: But
SPEAKER_02: I'm thinking,
SPEAKER_02: say you didn't have COVID,
SPEAKER_02: all the boys didn't have COVID.
SPEAKER_02: Is the video fucked now?
SPEAKER_02: Cause there's more of you.
SPEAKER_02: They can't fit in frame.
SPEAKER_02: But yeah, anyway,
SPEAKER_02: I'm conscious you guys
SPEAKER_02: have got some filming.
Unknown: We
SPEAKER_00: have some more Sidemen filming.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
